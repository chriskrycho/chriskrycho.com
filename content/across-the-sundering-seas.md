Summary: >
    I’ve just launched a newsletter, “Across the Sundering Seas” (buttondown.email/chriskrycho)—expect roughly weekly posts with a mix of commentary on links and some longer reflections on things I’m thinking about.

<i><b>[Assumed Audience][audience]:</b> people interested in reading *yet more* things I write.</i>

[audience]: https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html

So I hopped onto the bandwagon that everyone else is in 2019—with the excuse that I've been *thinking* about it since late 2017!—and started an email newsletter: [Across the Sundering Seas][link]

One reason I'm interested in the email newsletter as a medium is because I think it can *help* with [the assumed audience problem][audience]. A blog is written into the void, and has a certain kind of atemporality and acontextuality to it. Some readers follow along devotedly in their <abbr>RSS</abbr> readers; but equally someone may stumble on something I wrote half a decade ago. That is the beauty and wonder of blogs, and also their great challenge.

An email is a letter to an audience. Like a letter, you can respond, just by hitting the <b>Reply</b> button in your email client! But both of those benefits without the horrible-ness that is public comment threads, and with a much more direct kind of conversation. I can know you’re reading because you *want* to be, and I can write accordingly.

So here’s to seeing how this goes. I am excited to see how both this and my supporters-only podcast develop over the course of the year. You can [read the first issue][1], [subscribe][link], or just ignore this if newsletters aren’t your thing!
