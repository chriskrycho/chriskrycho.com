<i><b>[Assumed Audience](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html):</b> people who *really* like this website and like patronage or crowd-funding.</i>

Happy 2019, readers! As I move into 2019, I wanted to publicize something that has *existed* for most of the last year, but which I have not yet made much noise about: [my Patreon](https://patreon.com/chriskrycho)!

In this space, I write blog posts and essays on technology, theology, and art. I write about the process of building open-source software. I sometimes even write poetry and compose music and share those here! *I do all of those things no matter what.* But if you wanted to support my various efforts in this space by helping me stay well-supplied with delicious coffee, I'd really appreciate it!

The benefits for patrons, as I'm publicly launching it:

|        $1/month        |                                   $5/month                                    |                        $25/month                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| A shoutout on Twitter! | ⃪ plus access to a private podcast about what I'm thinking about and working! | ⃪ plus commentary and ancillary materials for my essays! |

I don’t expect this kind of patronage ever to be a massive part of my income. I do think it’s a good thing to support the writers and thinkers whose work impacts us, and so it’s important to *let* people support us if they’re interested in doing so! So if you’d like to support the work I do on this website, and especially if you’d like to see me do more of the important, careful essays that are the kinds of things I want to be doing, consider supporting me!

(Note that posts about this will not be a regular occurrence on the blog. I will probably integrate a link to the Patreon account into my RSS feed, but otherwise I will not mention it on the site more than once a year.)

Regardless of whether you support my work on this site financially, thank you for reading!
