As I’ve been slowly mulling on a number of things over the last few weeks, it became increasingly clear to me that I needed to invest a bit more in my research system. I’ve [asked before](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/how-do-you-manage-your-research-notes.html) how people manage their own research, and I’ve noted how [I use my blog as a note-taking tool of sorts](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/blog-as-note-taking-tool.html). As I’ve started digging into a couple larger problems—one of which is are likely going to take me a decade of work—I’ve come back to this question, and I find that I still don’t have great answers.

Something like the [Zettelkasten approach](https://zettelkasten.de) seems like it probably does what I need it to. So this week I’ve started organizing notes in [Bear](https://bear.app) that way. I’m *not* taking the tack sometimes advocated of intentionally having no hierarchy whatsoever for my notes, though I’m eschewing any particularly deep hierarchies. I consistently find that I need some kind of project or “notebook” level of organization when I’m digging deep on something, and it’s always nice to hear that I’m not alone in that. [Alan Jacobs, on the same topic:](https://blog.ayjay.org/my-zettelkasten/)

> Well, I thought, why not have a collection of Zettel that is based not on a lifetime of research but on a single project? So I tried that. And it worked wonderfully.

Unlike Jacobs, the notecard system doesn’t work for me. I enjoy writing notes by hand, but in a lot of cases I’m writing down code snippets, which is very hard to do on notecards unless the code snippets are *very* brief.  Instead, I’m so far making heavy use of Bear’s ability to [link between notes](https://bear.app/faq/Tags%20&%20Linking/How%20to%20link%20notes%20together/), and even heavier use of Bear’s [tagging system](https://bear.app/faq/Tags%20&%20Linking/Nested%20Tags/) for adding keywords to notes.

In line with my comment about hierarchy, though, I’m only allowing myself one level of hierarchy: the “project” or “notebook.” Everything in that “notebook” is a single keyword/tag deep, structured like `<notebook>/<keyword>`—never `<notebook>/<keyword>/<another keyword.`. I am also freely including tags across these “notebooks”: something might be in `A/q` and also `C/z`. That gives me the best of both worlds: project-level organization, but also the ability to see associations that play out beyond an individual project.

We’ll see how this plays out, but so far I’m liking it a lot.

Amusingly, it’s forcing me to clean up my existing set of notes in Bear: things tagged “writing/ideas” are now getting pushed over into a corresponding bucket in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), which is my preferred application for actually *writing*. Miscellaneous/non-project notes are currently going in a top level “notebook”—a top level tag in Bear—called `z` (for Zettelkasten). Under it I have things like `z/pedagogy`, but once again, I’m intentionally allowing myself only one level of nesting here. I am still [logging my work](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/just-write-down-what-you-do.html) in a work tag. And I also have notebooks for things like food, gift ideas, etc., since Bear is currently my go-to notes app. (This is part of what forced me to the project/notebook mentality in the first place: having dozens of top-level tags in that sidebar was just going to break my brain.) But hopefully having all these notes around and in a just-structured-*enough* form will be useful as I work on these larger projects.

I’ll report more as I keep going with this!
