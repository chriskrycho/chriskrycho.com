In this post, I’m going to trace out how I plan to do that, in hopes that it’ll help others write (and [finish](https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/947694285004201984)!) more blog posts—short posts, long posts, and everything in between. In another post (probably tomorrow or Thursday), I’ll explain *why* I think this is so important.

The game plan:

1. **Tweet less.** If you’re tempted to string together more than two or *at most* three tweets… you have a blog post. Seriously! At 280 characters, if you assume a word is roughly 5 characters on average, and toss in spaces and punctuation, you’ve got 40–45 words in a tweet. Three of those is 120–130 words. Five tweets is 200–225 words.

2. **Write down your ideas.** I have a `#writing/ideas` tag in [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8 "Bear by Shiny Frog on the App Store"), and new ideas I have just get thrown in there. When I have a day where I don’t have some *other* specific idea to tackle, I browse through that list and grab something that seems interesting. As an example: my [“Chrome is Not the Standard”](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html) post had just been sitting in there for a couple months when I finally got around to writing it up a few weeks ago.

3. **Be okay with being brief.** I’m a wordy guy, but I think many people feel the need to write *much longer* material now than they did in the early days of blogging, precisely *because* Twitter exists. It’s as if the existence of a microblogging platform makes us feel like a 200-word post doesn’t justify its own existence. I don’t believe that: [I write short posts sometimes!](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html "Momentum") And some of [my](http://blog.ayjay.org) [favorite](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/) [bloggers](https://css-tricks.com/many-ways-learn/) regularly do likewise.[^2]

4. **Be okay taking a while to finish.** Sometimes a piece can take a few weeks (or months!) to gel. That’s okay. Keep at it. Take some of your allocated writing time and keep plugging. That’s how I finally finished [this book review](https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/ "“Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins”").

5. **But finish things.** That means: get them to a spot where you’re ready to post them (even if they’re not perfect [because they never are!]) or eventually just throw them away. Both are allowed.

6. **Block out some time for it!** The main reason for my flurry of posts of late is that [I started writing every day before 7am](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html "Knowing Your Rhythms"). And that’s a habit I’m keeping! It helps. Some days it’ll be [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) scripts. Some days it’ll be [technical writing](http://www.chriskrycho.com/four-languages/). Some days it’ll be [reflections on \_Star Wars\_](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/star-wars-the-internet-and-me.html "Star Wars, the Internet, and Me"). But blocking out the time means *writing will happen*.
