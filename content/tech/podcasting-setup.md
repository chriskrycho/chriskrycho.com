## Introduction

I often get asked for recommendations about podcast recording: equipment, editing tools, approach, etc. So, at the request of several friends, I've put this post together as a one-stop shop to cover it *all*. This isn't coming from a professional podcaster---despite the sheer number of podcasts I produce, I'm still an amateur in terms of the role this plays in my life and the income I get from it---but I think it's actually all the more valuable for that reason. After all, *most* podcasters are amateurs!

My basic strategy here is simple: I'll comment on the section under discussion in general, give an intro-level recommendation, and then talk about what *I* do, which is often not the best place to start.

## Overview

The first thing to understand is that podcasting takes *work.* This is a point I've made [before][on-editing-podcasts], and [at length][mere-o], so I won't belabor it. But understand up front that while making a podcast isn't especially difficult, making a *good* one requires a considerable investment of learning and time spent per-episode---in preparation, during recording, and in editing.

Perhaps the single most-overlooked and also the most important part of podcasting is having some idea what you actually want to say. What is your show *about*? Far more important than the specifics of your recording setup is the question of whether you have something to say, and a distinctive way to say it.

There are thousands of podcasts out there. There are probably hundreds in the space you're entering. This might not be quite as crowded as the world of blogs, but you still need something unusual to catch people's attention. Quality can be one major part of that---and we'll talk about how you manage "quality" in a later section---but it's not likely to garner an audience all by itself.

### Subject matter

The first thing is straightforward and obvious enough: what are you going to be talking about? But obvious as it may be, you do need to sink some thought into this. "Programming" is far too broad, and though there may be some exceptions, things like "Programming in \<your favorite programming language>" probably are, too. Those exceptions would be younger or more niche languages. Ruby or JavaScript, though? Pretty well covered at this point, in terms of *generic* shows. If you want to make a podcast about a topic on which there are lots of other shows, you'll need to find an angle which makes it distinctive. Talking about cooking? Talk about a specific kind of cuisine. Talking about theology? Do something besides musing on whatever is big in the blogosphere or on Facebook lately. Talking about tech? Do something besides rambling about Apple.

### Form and Genre

### Voice

My high school English classes emphasized the importance of having a distinctive "voice": that is, of having a style that was recognizably one's own. The point was overplayed a bit, and no one ever quite said how to do that without jus ending up over the top. But the idea was sound: you need to find your own style. Are you funny? Serious? Thoughtful? If

## Editing

After _having a plan_, the process of editing is the one I think many podcasters overlook and which I most wish they didn't. The difference between a well-editors podcast and an unedited, little-edited, or badly-edited podcast is frequently the difference between my continuing to listen even past the first five minutes and my just giving up on a show entirely. There are only a couple shows I listen to which are poorly edited, and I listen for the interviewees, but they frustrate me constantly.

Don't be like those shows. Edit your podcast, and edit it well. What that means will be different for every show, but it's a necessity no matter what you're doing.

### Software
### Process

## Publishing

So you've recorded and edited your episode. Awesome! How is anyone going to listen to it? You need a place to host it and a way for people to get it in their podcatchers. (Don't look at me, I didn't make up the silly term.)

### Why not SoundCloud?

Some readers may wonder why I left out SoundCloud in my discussion of hosting platforms. The basic answer is: because I don't have any idea whether SoundCloud will still exist in a couple years, or whether they have any long-term commitment to podcasting. It's also substantially

## Income

Hey, you got your podcast out into the world. Congratulations! But now your spouse is looking at the sheer amount of time it takes you to do all that editing work and wondering if this is just giant black hole for your time from now on with nary a penny coming back as recompense for all those hours. Have no fear, you can make *dollars*, at least!

### Patreon

I titled this section "Patreon" because [Patreon] is what I use, but it could equally be titled "crowdfunding" or "listener support." I can't really speak to other crowdfunding platforms, but I've had a universally positive experience with Patreon. They take a reasonable cut of the overall patronage you receive, which makes it possible for *them* to keep operating, and provide everything to you through PayPal or Stripe. You can charge patrons on a monthly basis or on a per-release basis, depending on your schedule. I went to a per-release basis for a while in the fall, because I didn't feel comfortable charging listeners for zero episodes a month in October, November, and December. Now that I'm back to at least two substantive episodes a month here in 2017, I've gone back to a monthly payment.

Since I launched it, [sponsorship of New Rustacean][patreon-nr] has grown slowly but steadily, even through a relatively dry season of publishing episodes last fall. But it has taken me almost a year and a half to get to the current level of sponsorship I have, with a meticulously researched, written, and produced show. If I were relying on the money coming in from this to feed my family, I'd have to quit and go do something else. It's just way too much time in relative to the amount I make to be a *financial* justification for the time. Don't mistake me: I'm *profoundly* grateful for the support my listeners provide, and it's far more than I ever expected to be making from the show. But it's not that much in absolute terms. Don't expect to get rich on podcasting!

### Ads???

The other thing you're probably thinking about is ads. I have no insight here. Lots of shows have ads, and I could probably get some small amount of advertising revenue. However, it's *hard* to get a large enough audience for ads to make sense. Last year I reached out to [my favorite podcaster][snell] to get some info, and he kindly responded to [my report][initial-tweet] that I usually had 1,000--1,200 listeners:

[snell]: https://sixcolors.com/topic/podcasting/
[initial-tweet]: https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/724967589772951552

> [\@chriskrycho]\ [\@lexfri](https://twitter.com/lexfri) That's very small. At that level you may want to consider listener support instead.

That [wasn't my favorite thing ever][sad-response] to hear, but it's also roughly what I guessed. I have pretty great listener support, as I noted above, and while I'm open to advertising... I don't see that kind of sponsorship being a significant revenue source for my podcasting hobbies, unless one of my podcasts grows a much larger audience than current trends have made appear likely.
