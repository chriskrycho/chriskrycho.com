    I’ve been using Cronos for half a decade now—and as far as I can tell, I’m one of the only people out there using it! This lovely typeface deserves a wider showing!

I’m not sure when I first stumbled on [Cronos], but it was a *long* time ago at this point. I launched a version of this website using Cronos for titles back in 2012. I’ve experimented with a number of typefaces for the body text since then—including [Minion], [Gentium], and finally [Sabon]—but Cronos has never changed. Every time I’ve thought about moving away from it, I’ve been dissatisfied with everything else I’ve looked at using in its place. It makes for a *solid* choice for body text, but is a *remarkable* titling face.

And yet no one seems to know about it. I have never seen it on another website, or in print. (The three body typefaces I’ve used I have seen *plenty* of other places—online, in apps, and in print.) On the one hand, that’s kind of delightful: it gives my site a fairly distinctive identity. On the other hand, it’s a shame, because it’s such a lovely sans! It deserves a wider audience! I’ll gladly give up some of my site’s uniqueness to see this beautiful thing get more use.

It has *just* enough character to stand out from the wash of geometric and humanist sans that are in vogue these days, but it doesn’t call attention to itself or cross over into being *weird*. (“Weird” isn’t bad, to be clear: it’s often very good! But Cronos isn’t weird.) It’s interesting, but only if you stop to look at it closely. It almost wants to be a serif: there are little curls and hooks—as on the _r_ or _m_ or _n_ ascenders, or at the caps of the _A_ and _N_ and _M_. The _t_ has a little jag between its ascender and its crossbar. The descender of the _y_ is curved, just a little. End caps all swoop away, refusing to be totally straight. And yet when you take it all in on the page, none of those details are so bold that they actively draw your eye. They make it interesting, but never distract. It’s quirky and balanced and pairs perfectly with just about any serif you can throw at it (and many a sans, too). Go wild and pair with a monospace if you want! It somehow just *works*.

[Go use it][Cronos], people!
