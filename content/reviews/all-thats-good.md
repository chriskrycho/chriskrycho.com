Summary: >
    Recommended: Hannah Anderson’s All That’s Good is a popular theological treatment of the idea of “discernment”. The first several chapters are worth the price of the book; after that, it’s *fine* but not *amazing*, and seemed very much a product of the demands of the publishing industry (it read like "This could use a relatively basic exposition of the fruit of the Spirit to appeal more/fill out the page count"). Nonetheless, recommended in general and probably a very valuable book for women’s groups (to whom it seems targeted)--men would benefit equally, but the marketing will likely make that a harder sell.
