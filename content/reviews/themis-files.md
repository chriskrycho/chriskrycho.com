<i class=editorial>I keep my book review ratings simple---they're either *required*, *recommended*, *recommended with qualifications*, or *not recommended*. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:</i>

**Recommended:** <cite>The Themis Files</cite> is a delightful trilogy of books by Sylvain Neuvel, about the discovery of giant mecha (“robots” but they need drivers!) left on Earth by an alien race ~3,000 years ago. Popcorn, but *really fun* popcorn. Neither plot nor characters dazzle, but they also don’t have to for it to succeed as a rollicking sci-fi romp. And it keeps things interesting with a literary conceit I’ve never seen done quite this way before: every chapter is an interview transcript or a personal journal entry. This occasionally breaks suspension of disbelief—people don’t monologue all of these kinds of things!—but it mostly works, even when it shouldn’t. Fun enough, and short enough, that I read the whole trilogy in 3 days.
