<i class=editorial>I keep my book review ratings simple---they're either *required*, *recommended*, *recommended with qualifications*, or *not recommended*. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:</i>

**Recommended:** Mary Robinette Kowal picks up her alt-history of the space program after a meteor strike and continues doing what sci-fi does best: throwing new light on present-day cultural issues by showing something that *isn't* the present day. Where the first book looked head-on at sexism, the second carries that line forward but digs in on racism as well. And all this while still being an exciting *novel* with interesting characters and an engaging (if never quite surprising) novel. It doesn't have quite the same magic _The Calculating Stars_ did, but I still enjoyed it very thoroughly.
