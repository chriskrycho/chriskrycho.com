Big news: Today is my last day working for [Olo], and on Monday I start working on front-end infrastructure for [LinkedIn]!

[Olo]: https://www.olo.com
[LinkedIn]: https://linkedin.com

This is a huge change for me: I've been at Olo for almost exactly three years now[^tenure] and it has been the best job of my career. The people I'm leaving behind are fantastic, and I'm going to miss working with them day in and day out. This is the best team, and the best culture, of anywhere I've been so far. Granted a small sample size—Olo is only my third full-time job since I graduated college—I'm still comfortable saying that it's unlikely to be topped in *that* sense any time soon.

[^tenure]: The 18th was my 3-year anniversary, so it'll be just under three years and one week!

So: if Olo's people are so great and I've enjoyed working there so much… why am I moving on?

As a final aside: [Olo is hiring][jobs], and while I'm moving on, I actually *just* referred in a new senior front-end engineer, who's starting about a week after I'm done! I don't get a referral bonus anymore for sending people there way, so you can take this recommendation at face value.
