To the discussion yesterday of steady motion of intellectual leaders into Anglicanism in e.g. Colorado: it occurs to me that this is a pretty serious problem mirroring at a cross denominational level the same elitist/populist split currently wracking the SBC. I simultaneously _entirely_ understand the draw and think that if evangelicalism as such keeps bleeding its intellectuals, the problems in evangelicalism will all get much worse.

We need a commitment to putting down roots in and staying in denominations and working to shape them for the good—even, potentially, when running against the grain of those traditions, and possibly at the cost of great personal frustration; or, perhaps, great grace in our lives as we trust God with the results rather than assume our efforts will determine the outcomes.

Put another way: non-demons and Baptists may not value the evangelicals they have, but that just means they need them (us?) more than they realize.

What we need is the courage to stay, and the humility to sit under pastors who frustrate us with apparent blindness to real problems, and the grace to persevere in working quietly and perhaps with little or no visible fruit, to reform our own little places.

We readily decry church-hopping and shallow, emotional reasons for moving from one congregations. But we do the same too easily ourselves; the more apparent sophistication of our motives masks the same underlying self-absorption. We want our needs met. Sure, those needs may be less about the music and more about a particular attitude toward culture, but there's a real sense in which we're doing just the same things. We grow discontent. We wander when we don't feel like we fit. We expect our churches and denominations to serve us and meet our needs—intellectual instead of emotional, we might think; but in truth it is the emotional response _about_ the intellectual issues which often drives us—rather than looking at the gifts God had given us as opportunities to simply serve.

I say all that not sure if I will be a Baptist or a Presbyterian, or perhaps even an Anglican a year hence. But I am resolved, and increasingly so, that where we land, we will stay.

> on the other hand how should you balance the need and desire to serve God’s people in particular places with the desire to worship God in a manner true to your conscience or, indeed, in a way consistent with how He asks to be worshiped or in accord with the “faith once delivered to the saints”? —\@jaskonas

It is of course one thing to move because your convictions have shifted. (Thus my admission that I may be in a Presbyterian or even an Anglican church in a year.) But it is something else entirely to move simply because of the attraction of a more intellectual space.

and the reality and power of the draw of that latter attraction is such that we should carefully think when we are tempted to move. Is it really that our convictions have changed? Or is it that we are willing to change our convictions for the sake of feeling more comfortable? In reality, it is likely nearly always some combination of the two.

I am by no means inclined to say, "stay at all costs." I am inclined to say that we should be likelier to commit to a denomination, and to remain with it even in the midst of troubles, than we tend to be.

For another thing, many of the cultural attractions of a given denomination for us are organically – which is not to say essentially or inherently, though it may be so – connected to their doctrines. And the two combine in important ways in our attraction to them.

An obvious example: the general Baptist view on alcohol is both deeply connected to the theological emphases of the movement, and its basic pietist bent, and yet patently – at least from a historical perspective! – not essential to the movement. After all, Baptists invented bourbon!
