> | Almighty God,
> | who wonderfully created us in your own image
> | and yet more wonderfully restored us
> | through your Son Jesus Christ:
> | grant that, as he came to share in our humanity,
> | so we may share the life of his divinity;
> | who is alive and reigns with you,
> | in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
> | one God, now and for ever.
> | Amen.
