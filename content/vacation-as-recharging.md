Summary: >
    Rest is good, and needful; and resting well improves your work; but you cannot rest merely for the sake of your work.

I know, I know: I [*just* said](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/writing-plans-for-the-rest-of-2018.html) you wouldn’t be seeing many blog posts here. But I also said I wouldn’t be able to resist. And it’s Saturday! And I have *thoughts*. So.

As I noted last week, [taking a vacation](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/vacation-as-helpful-reminder.html) can provide helpful reminds to us. Not just, as I noted there, about our own role in our teams. Also about the importance and goodness of rest, and the way that we are better able to accomplish the good of *work* when we also rightly pursue the good of *rest*.

I took four half days. That was it. Not an extremely long or even a total vacation. But the difference it made… This week, I *more* than made up for those half days in productivity, both at work and in my side projects.[^1]

Rest is *essential* for us.

Now, what I’ve just written could be taken as a way of instrumentalizing rest: “Rest is good *because* it makes us better at working.” That’s not it. It’s rather that when we rest appropriately because rest is a good and necessary element of the design of human beings, we also find that we flourish in the other aspects of our lives. *Most* goods in our lives are simultaneously interrelated; and you cannot pursue one of those goods merely *for the sake* of another, failing to recognize it as a good in its own right, or usually you will end up getting *neither*.

[^1]:	Good grief, just look at how many words I posted yesterday.
