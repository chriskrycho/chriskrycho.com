    Don’t worry if it gets quiet around here: I’m just busy knocking out a lot of other things.

A quick note on what you can expect here over the next few months: mostly, not much that isn’t technical, and not *very* much of that. I suggested [a couple months ago](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/intentional-cyclicality.html "Intentional Cyclicality (March 6, 2018)") that it’s worth intentionally carving out different phases for different things, and I’m intentionally carving out a phase that’s lighter on blogging.

I have mapped out a pretty aggressive schedule for [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) to hit some (mostly but not entirely self-imposed) goals and deadlines—on which I’m *quite* behind.[^1] As such, *most* of my writing time needs to be dedicated to that through roughly September.

And it’s not going to change *much* even after that, because I have a *different* writing project I’ll be starting work on in October.

It’s not that you won’t get occasional blog posts on ethics and theology and so on. I don’t think I could stop myself from blogging that way from time to time if I *wanted* to. But it won’t be the focus, and if things are relatively quiet around here for much of the rest of the year, don’t worry… you know why!

[^1]:   As I’ve mentioned here [before](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/on-steam-specifically-running-out-of-it.html "On Steam (Specifically, Running Out of It)"): building a workshop for EmberConf proved to be even *more* work than I expected going into it, and I followed that up by giving talks at our engineering all-hands and Austin ATX a month later, and a talk at the Denver/Boulder Rust meetup just this week.

    Besides a lightning talk I’m giving at Denver Ember in June, I think I’m done giving talks of any sort for quite some time. Because seriously.
