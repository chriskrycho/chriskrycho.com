* At the end of January, I started as a staff software engineer at [LinkedIn], working on front-end infrastructure.
* I am in the training process to become a lay pastor at [my church][forestgate].
* I dealt with some nasty burnout in the latter half of 2018. I [blogged about it][burnout] quite a bit.
* My dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor October 2017. He's doing well after a successful surgery, a round of combined chemo and radiation, and a year of chemo treatments. But it was been a tough year.

## Podcasts

* [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a podcast about learning the Rust programming language. Usually updates 2--3&times; each month, but it's been a bit slow in the midst of my burnout.
* [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art; cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Usually updates biweekly… but the same qualification about burnout has been in play of late! Currently ongoing is [Season 6: Rejecting the Inevitable Future](https://winningslowly.org/season-6.html), in which we talk about *rejecting technology*---or rather, rejecting some technologies, not just as individuals but as communities.
* [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- playing through the _Mass Effect_ with my wife. Publishing somewhere between biweekly and monthly!

(For a list of _all_ podcasts I've hosted and their status, see [the dedicated page](/podcasts.html).)

## Speaking

* I'm giving [an updated version](https://emberconf.com/speakers.html#chris-krycho) of the 3-hour workshop on using TypeScript in Ember.js applications that I gave [last year](https://2018.emberconf.com/speakers.html#chris-krycho).
* I gave a lightning talk on <abbr>CSS</abbr> Modules at the Denver Ember meetup in late 2018.
* I gave a talk on Rust and WebAssembly at the Denver/Boulder Rust meetup in May 2018.
* I gave a talk on Ember.js and TypeScript at EmberATX in April 2018; you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzxbBrvytU).
* I gave a talk titled "Becoming a Contributor" at Rust Belt Rust 2017, October 26–27. The video is [up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abu2BNixXak), and you can also see the slides for the talk [here](/talks/rust-belt-rust/) or read the prepared script [here](/2017/becoming-a-contributor.html).

## Projects

* Since early 2017, I've been working on making the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js together awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.
* I published [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth), a library for safer (functional) programming in TypeScript, Flow, or plain-old JavaScript. You can read about the project [in its docs](https://true-myth.js.org) or in my introductory [blog post](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/announcing-true-myth-10.html).

### On Hold

* In early 2018, I started reading through and [writing about](/exploring-four-languages.html) implementing the exercises from Scott Wlaschin's _Domain Driven Design_ in Rust, Elm, F^♯^, and ReasonML. It's a ton of fun! I don't know if I'll ever finish it, alas.
* [lightning.rs](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs/) -- my static site generator project in Rust, which I'm currently hoping to get back to in late 2019. We'll see.
