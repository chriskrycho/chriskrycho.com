## Ongoing

* [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- a show about technology, religion, ethics, and art (or, as I sometimes like to joke: literally everything humans do), cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Biweekly episodes when in the middle of a season; otherwise at our leisure.

* [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- a show about the _Mass Effect_ trilogy, cohosted with my wife Jaimie. Weâ€™re currently aiming to publish at least one episode each month.

## Occasional

* [Sermons by Chris Krycho (dedicated RSS feed hosted on this site)](http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons.xml) -- if ever I preach anywhere, it'll be in this feed. Currently just limited to the sermons I preached for my sermon delivery class in seminary.

## Concluded

* [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a show about the Rust programming language. Concluded in May 2018 after just over 100 episodes!

* [Run With Me](http://runwith.chriskrycho.com) -- a micro-podcast about running. It's conceivable I may pick this up in the near future; I enjoyed this show a lot, but had my headphones, with their built-in microphone, destroyed by our cat; and I haven't bought another pair I can use that way, and it's been a few years, now...

* [Sap.py](https://sap-py.krycho.com) -- a short podcast I did with Jaimie about her adventures learning Python. Life got in the way and she chose to focus her many talents on other efforts.
