## Partial

Books I read *parts* of, but not the whole. There's no implication about quality either way, only that I chose not to finish them---sometimes that came down to level of interest as I went on; other times to the fact that they were assigned for class.

- _40 Questions About Creation and Evolution_,  Ken Keathley and Mark Rooker
- _God's Good World: Reclaiming the Doctrine of Creation_, Jonathan Wilson
