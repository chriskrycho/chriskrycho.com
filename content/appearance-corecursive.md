    Chatting with Adam Gordon Bell on Corecursive—mostly TypeScript, but also a bit of Rust, type theory, and productivity!

I was delighted to spend a bit over an hour [chatting with Adam Gordon Bell on the Corecursive podcast](https://corecursive.com/034-chris-krycho-typescript/). I was there officially to talk about TypeScript, and I did a *lot* of that… but we also dug into Rust a bit, of course, as well as talking about my schedule and “productivity”.

I’ve been podcasting for a few years now, but this was only the second time I’ve ever been on someone *else’s* podcast—and it was a blast. Thanks so much to Adam for having me on!
