Summary: &gt;
Defining a Zettelkasten—a way of organizing notes for long-term usability and profit.
Status: draft</p>
<hr>
<p><i><b><a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html">Assumed Audience</a>:</b> People interested in note-taking, effective learning, or the idea of a Zettelkasten (which <a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/zettelkasten/">I’ve written about before</a>).</i></p>
<p>A friend recently asked me: “What exactly <em>is</em> a Zettelkasten?” Unfortunately, there aren’t any (easy-to-find, anyway) answers in a single place online… hopefully until today![^background] The short answer is: a well-organized box (or group of boxes) of notecards. (The word itself is just German for <i>an index card box</i>.) Given you likely landed here via an internet search, though, I expect you might want a bit more.</p>
<p>A Zettelkasten as an idea dates to the work of the 20th German sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=Niklas%20Luhmann&amp;go=Go">Niklas Luhmann</a>, who used a large system of carefully labeled notecards (a <i>zettel</i>) as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. (As an aside, the linked Wikipedia article on hypertext notwithstanding, hypertext works perfectly well without any digital technologies: the real key to the idea is <em>links</em> that you can easily follow.) In the system Luhmann devised, each notecard gets a unique identifier, which can then be used to reference it from other notecards, and which have a well-defined order of some sort.[^order] They can also have keywords—tags—that group them into related sets of ideas. A full Zettelkasten also usually includes not just individual notes but also organizational notes. These serve as pointers and structure for whole other sets of notes—summaries of whole sets of knowledge you’ve built up over time.</p>
<p>Over time, this becomes a whole system of notes which can reference and build on each other into something more than the sum of their parts: not merely a <em>collection</em> but a <em>network</em> of notes. Each note is a node in a web of other notes, and if you build up the web carefully, you can follow its lines in novel directions over time, which is an aid to memory and learning—but, more importantly in my opinion, also to <em>insight</em>. Surprising connections between ideas can emerge over time. Those connections in turn can lead to whole new lines of questions and ideas.</p>
<p>And that’s it! A Zettelkasten is just a low-overhead, high-value way of creating, managing, and making use of a system of notes. It can use notecards, or <a href="https://bear.app">any good note-taking app</a>, or any combination of things that lets you easily “link” to and therefore navigate between notes.</p>
<aside>
<p>As it turns out, I’ve tried a lot of different apps for this kind of thing, and none of them quite hit the spot for me. So, being a good software developer… I’m building one.

<p>[^background]: I first learned about the idea <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/my-zettelkasten/">from Alan Jacobs</a>, and then more from <a href="https://zettelkasten.de">a dedicated site</a>—but while Jacobs’ post gives a reasonably good summary, as does <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/">this post</a> on that dedicated site, neither has much search prominence.</p>
<p>[^order]: I’ve chosen to organize my own Zettelkasten by date, because <a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/blog-as-note-taking-tool.html">I find</a> that seeing what I was thinking at a particular time can be very helpful and very interesting, and it’s also often a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/add-identity/">helpful way of remembering things</a>.</p>
