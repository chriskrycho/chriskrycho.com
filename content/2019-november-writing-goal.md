    I cannot commit to NaNoWriMo… but I can commit to a writing goal for the month of November: writing every day, averaging 500 words a day.

I am going to try something a little bit audacious in the month of November: to write every day, averaging (at least) 500 words each day.

I have wanted for years to do [NaNoWriMo]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month "national novel writing month"), but at this point I am unwilling to commit to the time to write 1,600 words of a novel per day—not least because of the up-front planning it would take me not to run out of story-telling steam.

I have *also* wanted to get my writing muscles back in gear for quite some time. While I have been blogging off and on over the past few years, my rate is much lower than it was even during certain parts of seminary. Perhaps most importantly, my longer-form work has simply come to a stop. I have started and then failed to finish a *lot* of essays over the past few years. I’d like to see that change.

So, for November, in the *spirit* of NaNoWriMo, I’m going to try to write every day. I’m aiming for an *average* of 500 words per day: a count that should be achievable, even if I don’t get there on every single day. (You’ll note that I missed yesterday… because I did not decide to take on this goal until today. However, I’ve already more than hit my target word count for the month *so far*, because [today’s issue][AtSS#27] of [my newsletter][AtSS] and this post together come out to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,500 words.)

Note that this is not a commitment to *publish* those 500 words per days on this site. It is a commitment to *write*. Some of those words I may throw away entirely; some I may publish here; some will certainly be newsletter issues (both for [Across the Sundering Seas][AtSS]); some may be [open-source software documentation][e-c-ts docs]; some may be actually making progress on some (possibly actually important!) essays that I want to publish *elsewhere*. But if I actually manage this, I’ll come out of the month with at least 15,000 words written. That’s not a novel worth, nor even a novella. But it *does* represent a real bump in output, and it should get my writing muscles moving again—especially if I can push some of that into essays and not just off-the-cuff materials like this blog post.

So this is me, rolling up my sleeves and getting to work. If you have been wanting to do more writing, give it a go with me! Write a little, every day. Maybe it’s just 100 words—that’s fine: the point is to keep moving. If you do, I’d love to know about it; shoot me an email!
