## Life

* We've recently moved to Colorado; we moved into a literal mountain lake house. (Some thoughts on that [here](https://krycho.com/were-in/)). Also, this:

* We got to see totality in the 2017 total solar eclipse! It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

## Speaking

* I gave a talk on Rust and WebAssembly at the Denver/Boulder Rust meetup in May.

* I gave a talk on Ember.js and TypeScript at EmberATX in April; you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzxbBrvytU).

* I gave a 3-hour workshop on using TypeScript in Ember.js applications at [EmberConf 2018](http://emberconf.com), in Portland, Oregon, on March 12, 2018. It got great feedback, so I'm quite happy with how it went! You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf-slides) and the example materials [here](https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf).

* I gave a talk titled "Becoming a Contributor" at Rust Belt Rust 2017, October 26–27. The abstract:

  > So, you’re new to the Rust community. (Or any community, really!) And you want to help, but, well, you’re new. So how exactly do you start contributing? What kinds of contributions are valuable? We’ll talk about everything from asking questions to writing documentation, from pitching in on forums and chat to writing blog posts, and from starting your own projects to contributing to other open-source projects.

  The video is [up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abu2BNixXak), and you can also see the slides for the talk [here](/talks/rust-belt-rust/) or read the prepared script [here](/2017/becoming-a-contributor.html).

## Podcasts

* [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a podcast about learning the Rust programming languare. Updates 2--3&times; each month.

* [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art; cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Usually updates biweekly! Currently ongoing is [Season 6: Rejecting the Inevitable Future](https://winningslowly.org/season-6.html), in which we talk about *rejecting technology*---or rather, rejecting some technologies, not just as individuals but as communities.

* [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- playing through the _Mass Effect_ with my wife. I've got two episodes we need to publish. We got distracted with things besides video games this summer, but we'll be back at it. Sadly, we packed up the game and our Xbox 360, so we won't be back at it _until_ we move in.

(For a list of _all_ podcasts I've hosted and their status, see [the dedicated page](/podcasts.html).)

## Projects

* I'm reading through and am [writing about](/exploring-four-languages.html) implementing the exercises from Scott Wlaschin's _Domain Driven Design_ in Rust, Elm, F^♯^, and ReasonML. It's a ton of fun!

* I published [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth), a library for safer (functional) programming in TypeScript, Flow, or plain-old JavaScript. You can read about the project [in its docs](https://true-myth.js.org) or in my introductory [blog post](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/announcing-true-myth-10.html).

* Over the course of 2017 and 2018, I've been working on making the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js together awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.

### On Hold

* [lightning.rs](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs/) -- my static site generator project in Rust, which I'm currently hoping to get back to in 2018. We'll see.

* [Rust and Swift](http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html) -- I tabled this to work on a project of the same focus for O'Reilly, who ended up canceling the project. I'm not sure I'll ever go back to it. I was really enjoying it, but that really burned me out, and in the meantime both Swift and Rust have moved on, a _lot_.

## Career

* I am working full-time at [Olo](https://www.olo.com) as a Senior Software Engineer, focused on making the experience of ordering food online as amazing as it can be. (We have a long way to go!)

* I have started doing some open-source work on the Glimmer compiler... in Rust!

* I finished my M. Div. in May 2017. _Finally._
