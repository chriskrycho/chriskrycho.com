* My wife and I just celebrated our tenth anniversary by taking a nice long trip to Jamaica, just the two of us. It was delightful!
* I recently wrapped up my long-running [New Rustacean](https://newrustacean.com) podcast project, and have just *started* working on an even more ambitious project: to build a genuinely great research writing environment—working title <b><i>re</i>write</b>. There’s a [mailing list for updates][rewrite].
* I started as a staff software engineer at [LinkedIn] early this year, working on front-end infrastructure.
* I dealt with some nasty burnout in the latter half of 2018. I [blogged about it][burnout] quite a bit. I expect to *keep* blogging about it as appropriate, but at a lower volume.

## Projects

* I am in the early phases of building [<b><i>re</i>write</b>][rewrite] (the working title): an incredibly ambitious vision for a genuinely great research writing environment.

* Since early 2017, I've been working on making the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js together awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.

* I published [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth), a library for safer (functional) programming in TypeScript, Flow, or plain-old JavaScript. You can read about the project [in its docs](https://true-myth.js.org) or in my introductory [blog post](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/announcing-true-myth-10.html).
