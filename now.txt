## Life

* I've been dealing with some serious burnout since June 2018. I've also been [blogging about that][burnout].
* My dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor October 2017. He's doing well after a successful surgery, a round of combined chemo and radiation, and ongoing chemo treatments. But it has been a tough year.
* We moved to Colorado last year---into a literal mountain lake house. (Some thoughts on that [here](https://krycho.com/were-in/)).
* We got to see totality in the 2017 total solar eclipse! It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

## Career

* I am currently working full-time at [Olo](https://www.olo.com) as a Senior Software Engineer. I'm open to other opportunites if they happen to be the right fit; check out my [C.V.].
* I have started doing some open-source work on the Glimmer compiler... in Rust!
* I finished my M. Div. in May 2017. _Finally._

## Podcasts

* [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a podcast about learning the Rust programming language. Usually updates 2--3&times; each month, but it's been a bit slow in the midst of my burnout.
* [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art; cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Usually updates biweekly… but the same qualification about burnout has been in play of late! Currently ongoing is [Season 6: Rejecting the Inevitable Future](https://winningslowly.org/season-6.html), in which we talk about *rejecting technology*---or rather, rejecting some technologies, not just as individuals but as communities.
* [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- playing through the _Mass Effect_ with my wife. I've got two episodes we need to publish. We got distracted with things besides video games in 2017 and early 2018, but we'll be back at it.

(For a list of _all_ podcasts I've hosted and their status, see [the dedicated page](/podcasts.html).)

## Speaking

* I gave a talk on Rust and WebAssembly at the Denver/Boulder Rust meetup in May.
* I gave a talk on Ember.js and TypeScript at EmberATX in April; you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzxbBrvytU).
* I gave a 3-hour workshop on using TypeScript in Ember.js applications at [EmberConf 2018](http://emberconf.com), in Portland, Oregon, on March 12, 2018. It got great feedback, so I'm quite happy with how it went! You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf-slides) and the example materials [here](https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf).
* I gave a talk titled "Becoming a Contributor" at Rust Belt Rust 2017, October 26–27. The video is [up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abu2BNixXak), and you can also see the slides for the talk [here](/talks/rust-belt-rust/) or read the prepared script [here](/2017/becoming-a-contributor.html).

## Projects

* I published [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth), a library for safer (functional) programming in TypeScript, Flow, or plain-old JavaScript. You can read about the project [in its docs](https://true-myth.js.org) or in my introductory [blog post](http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/announcing-true-myth-10.html).
* Over the course of 2017 and 2018, I've been working on making the experience of writing TypeScript and Ember.js together awesome. [typed-ember](https://github.com/typed-ember) on GitHub is where all the action is at. I've also been writing a series of blog posts, ["Typing Your Ember"](http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/), to help people get off the ground.

### On Hold

* I've been reading through and [writing about](/exploring-four-languages.html) implementing the exercises from Scott Wlaschin's _Domain Driven Design_ in Rust, Elm, F^♯^, and ReasonML. It's a ton of fun! I expect to pick it up after I get through this burnout, as well as wrapping up some other personal projects.
* [lightning.rs](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs/) -- my static site generator project in Rust, which I'm currently hoping to get back to in 2018. We'll see.
* [Rust and Swift](http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html) -- I tabled this to work on a project of the same focus for O'Reilly, who ended up canceling the project. I'm not sure I'll ever go back to it. I was really enjoying it, but that really burned me out, and in the meantime both Swift and Rust have moved on, a _lot_.
