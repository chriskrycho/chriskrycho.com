&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=editorial&gt;I keep my book review ratings simple—they’re either &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;recommended&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;recommended with qualifications&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;not recommended&lt;/em&gt;. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Required.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Beowulf&lt;/cite&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; great work of Old English literature, the oldest &lt;em&gt;literary work&lt;/em&gt; in English full stop. It should be required reading (in a good translation!) for every high school student in English-speaking nations. I am not going to try to review it here; I’m not sure you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; review a work like this, exactly. As well try to review the Iliad. (People with expertise in Old English could perhaps offer a review of the &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt;, but I have no such expertise.) I offer instead a few notes on my experience of reading it for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first: there are many ways to read this book. I read Seamus Heaney’s much-lauded translation, in &lt;a href="https://www.wwnorton.com/books/9780393320978"&gt;this bilingual edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I had no idea what to expect from the poem. I have not spent much time reading epic poetry (to my loss, I think!), and I had only the vaguest familiarity with the story. I cannot judge the accuracy of the translation, but I can say this for it: it was good poetry, and I found it thoroughly engaging. It was like and unlike reading a novel, for many reasons: the medium, of course, and most obviously; but also the form and structure—because this poem (of course!) knows nothing of a genre that developed most of a millennium after it had been written! It gripped me, as a good story does. The language was beautiful, and as a poem it &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt; in a way that the prose of very few novels even begin to hint at.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have now a great desire to find and read more—much more—of Seamus Heaney’s own poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I cannot help but comment on the physical presentation of the text here. The &lt;a href="https://www.wwnorton.com/books/9780393320978"&gt;edition&lt;/a&gt; I have is a bilingual text, with the Old English on the left page and Heaney’s translation on the right. The presentation of Heaney’s introduction and translation are lovely—well-typeset in Palatino. The bilingual materials, which I was glad to have (consider my curiosity about Old English very much piqued!), is unfortunately much &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; well-typeset. It appears to be in Times New Roman, and if TNR is over-criticized and underappreciated, it simply looks jarring(ly bad) when set side by side with Palatino. The typesetting of the non-bilingual text appears to be the same as in my copy of the text, so I would commend that to you instead of the edition I read for most readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If I had to guess, I would venture this failure was a function of the comparative dearth of options available to set Old English text 20 years ago. Today we have a striking wealth of typefaces with incredibly multilingual support, including for the characters used in Old English—so I would love to see this bilingual presentation re-typeset at some point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never read the poem, you should! I enjoyed it greatly, and I expect to come back to it in the years ahead. And who knows: I may even slowly pick up Old English to be able to appreciate the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only books I have read which come anywhere close are Tolkien’s; no surprise there for long-time readers of mine, but also no surprise for anyone who is familiar with Tolkien’s own history with &lt;cite&gt;Beowulf&lt;/cite&gt;. His encounter with it shaped him in profound ways; and he in turn shaped the field of studies of the text in profound ways.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I have a bunch of mostly-unformed thoughts, and I want to write, and the two come out here, together, in the next few minutes before I start my workday proper (because I stayed up late last night working on open source software and got up late accordingly, and so have a great deal less of &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="“Knowing Your Rhythms”"&gt;my normally-allocated writing time&lt;/a&gt; available today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a very strange place, and the dynamics of it favor those of us who already have well-paying jobs and lots of flexibility in our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing. It means that anyone who wants to use open-source contribution as a gauge of someone’s fitness to work is making a pretty foolish decision, though: they’re inherently cutting off a whole sector—dare I say it, a whole &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;—of people who simply do not (and, barring being given a pretty surprising break, will never) have that kind of stability and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad for meaningful discussion. I follow both &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/noahpinion"&gt;Noah Smith (@noahpinion)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky"&gt;Lyman Stone (@lymanstoneky)&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re both extremely interesting follows, and they’re both clearly &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; smart and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well-informed, and in their off-Twitter writing they both do a good job of fairly representing others’ views and interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, their arguments are a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specific to Smith and Stone. This is Twitter in one pair of interlocutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously: stop tweeting and start blogging again, if you have an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; to make rather than just a pithy, one-off observation or a link to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a surprising amount of writing done in 5 minutes, if you’re willing to just word-vomit. (This whole post, start to finish, took me 12 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more poetry; more rich, good fiction; more rich, good nonfiction. I’ve read a lot of nonfiction in the last five years, but I wouldn’t call most of it &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;. Most of it—most of my seminary reading, that is—was &lt;em&gt;just okay&lt;/em&gt;; very little of it engaged deeply with thought critical of its own perspective. (Major exceptions: David Koyzis’ really excellent &lt;em&gt;Political Visions and Illusions&lt;/em&gt;, Alvin Plantinga’s &lt;em&gt;Where the Conflict Really Lies&lt;/em&gt;, and of course St. Athanasius’ &lt;em&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find that my own writing is far sharper, clearer, and better when I’m drawing &lt;em&gt;widely&lt;/em&gt; and from &lt;em&gt;deep wells&lt;/em&gt;. Widely, because I find that too much time in the same spot overly narrows my focus, whether that is apologetics or programming languages. From deep wells because, frankly, there is too much out there which warrants nothing more than a skim &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
