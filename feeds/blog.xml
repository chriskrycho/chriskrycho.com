</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skimming through Twitter this morning, two threads caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kyleshevlin/status/1040674991392452608"&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt;, by Kyle Shevlin, pushes back on the idea that people should be expected to just pick up and move across the country for a job—never mind the personal and communal costs to them. This stands at the crux of the point he’s making (but the whole thread is good; I encouraged him to turn it into a blog post):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t even pay attention to this [i.e. the lack of communal ties and third spaces in our lives]. The pastor/philosopher in me gets frustrated with the lack of concern over the loss of community. Instead, we have tried to replace our relationship to other people with the relationship to our work and work place.&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kyleshevlin/status/1040674981468758016"&gt;@kyleshevlin &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/1040778111057444866"&gt;The second&lt;/a&gt;, by Stephanie Hurlburt, gently but firmly tells guys to stop trying to &lt;em&gt;flirt&lt;/em&gt; with the women they meet at professional meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am noticing a trend in women age 18-22 I’m mentoring— they try to network and get mentoring and go to meetups and literally every guy they try to talk with gets flirty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;em&gt;blocked&lt;/em&gt; from this professional advancement because so many guys jump straight into trying to date&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/1040778111057444866"&gt;@sehurlburt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Stephanie’s point here, but it was the juxtaposition with Kyle’s point that particularly caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without excusing the young men who turn from professional networking to flirting immediately on encountering an attractive woman at a tech meetup—again, don’t do that!—it’s also worth addressing the structural reasons why move is so tempting. (As usual, these kinds of things are worth addressing &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org/season-5"&gt;both individually and structurally&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be addressed both ways to see real change.) One of the structural issues which leads to “see an attractive woman at a JavaScript meetup, decide to flirt with her” is the thing Kyle is pointing at. Namely: we’ve offloaded the vast majority of our social existence to work.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given that many of these young men have no other social contexts… where exactly &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they going to flirt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good and right to do as Stephanie does here and say, “This isn’t the right place for this, guys.” But—and this is no critique of Stephanie’s point; not every blog post or every tweet is responsible to cover every angle on a topic!—we also need to substantially reorient our understanding of the place of professional contexts in our lives. Leaders need to stop framing their companies as “a family”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, even more, need to recognize that companies are not &lt;em&gt;and cannot be&lt;/em&gt; the solution to this problem. To the contrary. When a company responds to their employees’ felt need for more community by trying to become that community, it reinforces the actual problem. Counterintuitive though it might seem, the best thing company leaders can do for their employees is make sure that their company is &lt;em&gt;just a job&lt;/em&gt;. (If you want to do more than this, find healthy local community spaces and support &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt;—financially, by promoting them, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighborhood book clubs, churches, recreational sports, local art-making of all sorts, topical discussion groups, political activism, community service… these are the actual kinds of activities and institutions we need more of. Not more of company-as-community, professional-as-identity. If we work hard to build those thicker, healthier kinds of spaces, then professionally-focused spaces actually can remain professional. They won’t have to do work they aren’t meant to do, and ultimately can’t do well without compromising their primary work.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking at you, Medium.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the (really excellent) content in Vaidehi Joshi’s &lt;a href="https://medium.com/basecs"&gt;basecs&lt;/a&gt; series, and it crystallized something for me: Algorithmically-sorted archives for blogs are hyper-user-hostile and I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to just work through that series in chronological order of publication is &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt;—not quite &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt;—impossible. Never mind that the series is a &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt;, and that most posts build on earlier posts, Medium wants to &lt;em&gt;foster engagement&lt;/em&gt; and tell you what other people have read most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It keeps up this nonsense even when you pull the the Archive view: it displays the top 10 posts from 2017, sorted by which ones people read most. There’s no view of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the posts in the series, simply sorted by date, period. You can sort those top 10 posts by date, but to get to the series in chronological sequence, you have to click into each month… and then click the button &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; to sort by date &lt;em&gt;for every single month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This absurd focus on algorithmic sorting is an abomination—a desecration of all that is good and noble and beautiful about the format of the blog. It should die an ignominious death, unmourned by anyone but Silicon Valley venture capitalists thinking to make a quick buck on other people’s publishing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s an illuminating experience, a lot like reading through old notes.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a habit that might not make sense to you. I reread my own blog posts fairly regularly. It’s not vanity—not some weird obsession with my own awesomeness in the form of my own writing or some such nonsense. It’s that in my blog posts over the last decade, I have a pretty serious backlog of &lt;em&gt;what I was thinking about at any given point in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exhaustive, by a long shot. It only includes things I actually decided to publish.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are, sadly, not many short thoughts in the mix. Nor is it well-tagged or organized in any internally-consistent way—even in any single version of the site, much less across versions. But nonetheless the history is still there, and I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; traverse the various lines through it, such as they are. (Sometimes, even, the changes in organization and structure are illuminating about how I was thinking about things at the time!) In any case, my habit of linking to previous references to ideas has proven invaluable for the times when I want to trawl back through old posts and consider those old thoughts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading old blog posts is a strange experience, of course. The person who wrote these things was recognizably myself; but I am not who I then I was, and I sometimes disagree with myself on the substance and often on the style. (I occasionally find an old gem and wonder how I ever managed to write so well.) That very strangeness, it turns out, is why I do this every so often, though. Thinking well is often a matter of forging connections between ideas that were previously not connected for us. We cannot consciously hold in our minds even a fraction of all the things we have thought about or even written something about over the years. We can, however, jog our memories, and let new connections form. And rereading one’s own blog post is a great way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d not heard specifically of the &lt;a href="https://zettelkasten.de"&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt; until Alan Jacobs linked it a while back, but it fits this model pretty perfectly, and maps as well to ways I’ve been &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to structure my note-taking and thinking for the past few years. (I’m going to be consciously doing more of this in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, my current notes app of choice. I’ll probably write up my experience that way once I’ve actually had some experience!) But this also ties into some of the things Jacobs has been &lt;a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-blog-garden/" title="The Blog Garden"&gt;musing out loud&lt;/a&gt; about in his own blog over the last week. It’s not just that a blog can serve as a place to do some of the fleshing-out of ideas. It’s not just that a blog can be a record of the development of ideas. It can also serve to jog new ideas if you read yourself again, displaced (both literally and temporally) from the original writing of the thing. A blog is kind of like a public notebook, and while it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be useful for others to browse through it, is &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; useful for me to browse back through it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is far from as bad as it could be, and I am doing the things I should to mitigate it. But it is real, and dangerous, and I hope this post might help others keep their eyes open for it.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came to terms with reality a bit last week. It wasn’t fun. I concluded something attentive folks around me have likely known for a bit: I am dealing with low-level &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642" title="The Mayo Clinic’s summary of burnout"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you become cynical or critical at work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started once you arrive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you become irritable or impatient with co-workers, customers or clients?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you lack the energy to be consistently productive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you lack satisfaction from your achievements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel disillusioned about your job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to simply not feel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your sleep habits or appetite changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you troubled by unexplained headaches, backaches or other physical complaints?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic (the source for that list) notes that if you’re suffering from any &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those, you may be experiencing burnout. By my count, I am experiencing &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re looking at the list and wondering: the first six. No changes to sleep, no abuse of food or drugs or alcohol, and I haven’t started having physical problems yet, which is why I classify what I’m experiencing as low-level or mild. But burnout is tricky. I’ve know a number of people who’ve had more serious cases—cases which led into significant physical problems that took them years to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, when people think about burnout, they tend to think of the kind that comes from &lt;em&gt;overwork&lt;/em&gt; or from a lack of rest. You certainly can (indeed: certainly will) burn out by pulling 80-hour weeks for years on end. But those are not the only way you can burn out. You can also do it by ending up in a spot where you have too much responsibility, or deep and lasting conflict within your working environment, or sharp ethical disagreements with your leadership, or even just—“just” being the wrong word here—lasting mismatches between your tasks and the things you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular reasons for my mild case of burnout aren’t the stereotypical kind. I get plenty of sleep, I enjoy my hobbies, I exercise and eat well, and I very carefully maintain a limit on the hours I work every week. I’m not &lt;em&gt;overworked&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a mix of other factors I won’t go into. The details aren’t actually that important here, and in any case my (genuinely excellent) manager knows them well and we are working on them together.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is important is trying to figure out how to keep the burnout from getting worse. And acknowledging that it can happen to anyone. And that you may not see it coming, may deny you’re experiencing till something finally makes it click for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this all finally click for me? It was &lt;a href="http://www.alliancenet.org/mos/postcards-from-palookaville/six-years-on#.W0vQM4pMFvI" title="Six Years On"&gt;this post by Carl Trueman&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on his own &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different vocation—specifically, his bivocational work as both a pastor and a professor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months into my pastorate, an academic friend who had done the same thing for nine years wrote me a letter and urged me to be careful – as soon as I ceased to enjoy the hobbies and casual pleasures of life, he warned, I would be close to burn-out and would need to step down. I was glad of the warning – every minister I have ever know who has burned out has told me that there was no obvious warning: one day everything seemed fine, the next they were barely able to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That started me thinking on my own experience, and if I’m not quite there, I can see warning signs. The biggest danger sign, for me, is an utter lack of motivation around some of my hobbies. I generally relax, as my wife can attest, in &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; ways—by writing, by building an open-source library, by reading hard-and-interesting books. For the last several months, I have had almost no interest in doing any of that. So I’ve a mild case at the moment, and I’m doing everything I can to keep it from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout like I have right now is not the end of the world, to be clear. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; manageable. Many people—including people in my own family—carry much more significant burdens in terms of physical and mental health. But it is real, and it’s dangerous in no small part because it can cascade into really serious mental and physical health problems if you let it spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I’m a bit slower on open-source projects for a while, you know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to be that blog post for someone else. If you’re experiencing the things on that list, figure out how to change &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can assume that it’s not sharp conflict over ethical issues, because nothing in the world would make me jet from a job faster than that would&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

The habit has been productive. Time to start building another new habit (even while I maintain this one)!
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since December, I’ve been working on &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms--Or: why I&amp;#39;m marking out all the time before 7am as mine."&gt;writing every day before I start work&lt;/a&gt;. I am content to admit that I certainly haven’t done it every single day along the way–but I’m content with that admission in no small part because I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; done it &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; days along the way. And it has been genuinely wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I have written along the way have come in many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve published around 50,000 words on this site already this year (even if ‘word count’ here is a loose metric: it includes lots of code samples and in some cases those code samples are repeated for effect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve put together a workshop and a couple of short talks on &lt;a href="https://www.emberjs.com"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve written a talk on the future of our front-end development practices at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve written and published 11 episodes of New Rustacean (totaling about 25,000 more words!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And very little of that could have or would have happened without the time I’ve dedicated nearly every weekday morning to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not so much that I’m hyper-productive on any one day. To the contrary: many days along the way I struggled just to get out a few hundred words of one of the projects I was working on, and those projects (however much I love them) have sometimes ended up being something of a slog. It’s okay: that’s the point of building the habit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the analogy before–as have many others, I’m sure!–of writing to running. There are many days when going for a run doesn’t actually seem all that appealing, but I go anyway, because I’ve long since developed the habit of just getting out whether I feel like it or not. Some of those days I very much do not enjoy the actual run, either: I find myself somewhere out along the way and end up feeling sick or simply having to work much harder than I could wish. But even if it’s a short and unpleasant run in the end, I come away having gone for a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing (or any other valuable habit) seems to be much the same. There are days I do not feel like doing it. There are days when the doing of it is hard, when I feel like I have to drag the words out of myself. There have been days even just in the last few weeks where I realized that words I’d written on previous days simply had to be thrown away–content for New Rustacean that ranged from ill-worded to actually-wrong, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have been able to say, nearly every workday when I wasn’t sick or traveling, that I did in fact write &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. And that’s enough, in truth. As I noted &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html" title="Momentum--Two weeks of daily writing, and how &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; happens."&gt;when I began building this habit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The] early morning is the best time for me to be writing, and I get a lot of mileage out of taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recognized six months ago, even when an individual day here or there slips, doing the work to make writing habitual means that the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; days don’t. The result is that, delightfully, I’ve been able to get a lot of writing done, even through times when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn’t feel like writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next up: do the same thing with reading nonfiction books. I’ve read an absurd amount of fiction in the last year–and I allowed myself that intentionally as a kind of letdown after finishing seminary. But as I’ve noted in this space before, I don’t want to stay in that letdown mode forever. I want to build once again the habit of reading hard books carefully. The way to do it, of course, is… just to do it. Day by day, just &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully in six months I’ll have a report complementary to this one, where I can say that I &lt;em&gt;kept writing&lt;/em&gt; but also &lt;em&gt;started reading hard things again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last month, in particular, I’ve been thinking about the kind of “link-blogging” and commentary-on-articles-I’ve-read that I’ve experimented with pushing into Pinboard for the last &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/pick-the-right-tool-for-the-job.html"&gt;year and some change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I’ve found that Pinboard is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having an easy place to look up articles I’ve read but can’t necessarily remember the name of off the top of my head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; place with its own &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt; feed of that content, which is social-network-like in some ways but using open web tech like &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it isn’t is &lt;em&gt;integrated with my own site&lt;/em&gt;, or particularly easily discoverable &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; my site. Adding a link to my public Pinboard feed would help, perhaps, but you wouldn’t know what I use it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; from seeing that link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I want this material here on this site. There remain two blockers to me there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;site design and structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I am happy enough with a static site generator setup. However, for this specific kind of use, I wish for a web front-end to my website (or, honestly, an easy way to integrate &lt;a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; with it). The options which exist in that general space—WordPress and Ghost—both have their upsides, but also a great many downsides, and I find that I have no interest in using either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might find that an odd commitment; here’s an aside on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://krycho.com"&gt;family blog&lt;/a&gt; is a Ghost install, and the previous iteration of this site ran on WordPress. Ghost is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, and for many setups it’s actually really good. For my fairly complex set of publishing requirements, it unfortunately doesn’t really do the trick. Some of those requirements (like integration with citation-management tooling) are &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; less pressing, but I don’t count on that being the case in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, one possible alternative here is simply to cross that bridge if or when I come to it and lean on the somewhat simpler tools that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; meet my needs for today. If I did that, it would certainly be with Ghost, because WordPress feels to me the same way Windows feels to me: technically very competent, but impossibly frustrating to use. (That’s not insulting either of the two; it’s a statement of my very—overly, perhaps!—specific aesthetic tastes and my corresponding—admittedly irrational!—response to the experience of using Windows or WordPress. Maybe it’s just the ‘W’s that start the names?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one reason I’ve seriously considered figuring out how to make my &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;long-on-hold site generator&lt;/a&gt; actually be a hybrid: never dynamically generating content, but with an &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; to enable programmatic access, so that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; put a web or app front end on it. (Existing solutions in that space, like &lt;a href="https://www.netlifycms.org"&gt;Netlify CMS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://forestry.io/"&gt;forestry.io&lt;/a&gt;, are really good, but don’t quite support everything I have historically committed to needing. They also don’t have anything like an iOS share sheet!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that I’m not yet ready to spend my limited time building out my long-planned and long-delayed personal website generator tool. In short, I’m caught in a catch-22 of my own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I want to figure out a flow for sharing those kinds of notes-on-articles that works better for getting it onto my blog, rather than caught in the mostly-invisible space that is my Pinboard. I need a refreshed site design to support it effectively. I need different &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; to support that flow effectively. Which means I’m not going to end up doing it tomorrow or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll get to it eventually. Maybe. Hopefully. And in the meantime I’ll do one extra step when I see something worth linking, and copy it into a Ulysses document that I can publish shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where every nerd ends up with their blogging software, I think: in a pit of good-enough-to-get-by but not-actually-satisfying. (But I’m not helping myself with how persnickety I am about these things.)&lt;/p&gt;

Good arguments are invaluable for clear thinking and the pursuit of truth.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m working my way slowly and carefully through Shannon Vallor’s &lt;cite&gt;Technology and the Virtues&lt;/cite&gt; and as I put it to my friend and partner-in-&lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; Stephen Carradini: I find that I &lt;em&gt;very often&lt;/em&gt; agree with Vallor on her conclusions while &lt;em&gt;equally often&lt;/em&gt; disagreeing with her on how she gets there. It makes for very interesting reading, certainly; and so far, at least, I can pretty heartily commend the book despite my disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reason why I can so heartily recommend it is what I’m more interested in at the moment. Vallor is a really excellent &lt;em&gt;conversation partner&lt;/em&gt;. Not all writers are. But &lt;cite&gt;Technology and the Virtues&lt;/cite&gt; is the kind of book that is sufficiently well-written and well-argued&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the very act of disagreeing with it—if you take the time, anyway—produces light rather than merely heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good conversation partner prompts you to think hard about the differences between her position and your own. She pushes you to articulate &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you disagree, and whether your disagreements are well-founded, and if not to see if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; provide a good foundation for them. Vallor has this and in spades. I have pages of notes both agreeing with many of her points and also articulating why—as a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; interested in virtue ethics—I differ sharply with her in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes all of this valuable is that these are &lt;em&gt;illuminating&lt;/em&gt; differences. I have a better sense of some of the gaps at least in my own education in Christian ethical systems.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have a better sense of the space in which Stephen and I are playing with Winning Slowly &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org/season-6.html" title="Rejecting the Inevitable Future"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;. I have clarified my own view of the relationship of virtue and wisdom and law in meaningful ways in just the short time I’ve been working through this book—and I can feel the gears turning still in the background; there is a lot more sharpening to come from this.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about the benefits of reading those you disagree with, this is what they mean. The best interlocutors are those who push you like this—whether you agree or disagree, they make you work harder and think more sharply. Good arguments are invaluable for clear thinking and the pursuit of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing this points at is that good thinking often begets good thinking. I actively &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to think well about these things, but I also am unable to do as well in a vacuum as I can with the help of others who are thinking hard and well about them—even, and sometimes &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt;, when we disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I blog is as an attempt to think well out loud. I cannot make others think well no matter how well I think; and I certainly do not presume that my own thinking &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; always thinking well. But the act of writing, and writing publicly, is an attempt to do the kind of work (on however small a scale) that I see people like Vallor and &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org" title="Snakes and Ladders"&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com"&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt; doing in their own spaces. If I can do even a fraction so well as they are in my own space, perhaps I too can help others think well. At the least, I know I am learning to think better along the way, and that is no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are different! Complementary, but different.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/the-chinese-room-argument.html#fn2"&gt;footnote 2 on an earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; for a comment on why I assume the problem is likely with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probable that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; quite a bit of specifically Christian reflection on many of these ideas; I simply haven’t encountered it. This may also say some things about the specifics of my theological education; I think it does and may return to that in a later post, but that’s neither here nor there.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vallor sees virtue ethics as incommensurable with deontological accounts of ethics; I think the two are meant to complement one another. The structure of Biblical ethics is both deontological and virtuous. In particular, my read of the Wisdom literature (as well as the New Testament account of righteous life which builds upon it) is that the Biblical account sees virtue (or righteousness) and wisdom as the fruit—and I choose that word intentionally—of life lived under God’s enduring law. The moral precepts do not change; their specific applications are plurifold, and the shape of Biblical ethical reflection itself is likewise wide-ranging. Put more simply: life lived under God’s law in his power &lt;em&gt;yields&lt;/em&gt; wisdom. This is not so different from Vallor’s picture of the virtue ethics of Aristotle, Confucius, or Buddha—save that wisdom in the Biblical account does not &lt;em&gt;supercede&lt;/em&gt; God’s law; it comes to rightly apprehend &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; God’s ways are rightly applied in every circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vallor rejects the notion of any singular account of a human &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; or specific nature (other than what we have been given by evolution) that is capable of grounding the pursuit of virtue across all cultures. She aims for a kind of ethical pluralism that can account for the various cultural notions of human nature and &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; without falling into ethical relativism or absolutism. I don’t think her account can actually support this weight, though. By contrast, I think Christianity &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have the resources to support the kind of pluralism she rightly recognizes as necessary because its account of human naature and &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; are rich enough to embrace the goods of many cultures and contexts and wisdom traditions. (That Christianity has not perfectly or even very much at all lived up to this potential is, as Vallor herself notes of her own account of virtue ethics, by no means a defeater for the claim.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more to say here, and I will—later!&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A thing I’ve been thinking about a bit over the last few weeks is how to sustain motivation as you come into the “this no longer holds any intrinsic interest for me” phase of a project. I have a couple of these on my plate right now, but I also want to &lt;a href="http://esv.to/col3.23" title="Colossians 3:23"&gt;do my work well&lt;/a&gt;. Here I’m jotting down a couple of the strategies I’ve been taking so far; I’ll probably have another post like this in roughly six months when these particular projects are wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 1. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find related problems you can solve that support the effort or the team, which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; intrinsically interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you keep your eyes open, you can sometimes find problems which don’t &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; advance the project you’re working on, but which both &lt;em&gt;indirectly&lt;/em&gt; advance the project and also give you something to work on when you need a break. In my context, this looks like small but broadly-useful pieces of developer tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: we’re in a spot where we’re spinning up a number of new applications in a given framework and stack. After getting through everything else on my plate this last Friday, I took a couple hours and started putting together a little tool that will make the major part of that process a single command-line invocation. This doesn’t directly advance the project I’m working on. But it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be useful for our whole team over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example here for me is identifying technical initiatives we need, and taking the time to think through how we can accomplish them. These are real problems that we really need to solve, and even if we don’t need them solved &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; (because we’re prioritizing other things), there is a lot of value in figuring out we’ll solve them when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get to them in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those kinds of things can help by giving a sense of accomplishment while simultaneously doing something &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; the main task, but they don’t require huge blocks of time or keep you from getting the main project done. And they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; advance your team or your project in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 2. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find tasks which are &lt;em&gt;totally unrelated&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;instrincically interesting&lt;/em&gt;, but which do not keep you from getting your main job done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of like the previous task except that it may or may not even be related to what you’re working on. I have a couple pieces of technology work that I variously have started and will be starting that are totally unrelated to my main projects. But they’re things that I can go after a bit here and a bit there – the last half hour of a day when my brain is shot, or over lunch, or for a few hours when I’ve finished everything else on my plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of things help me by serving as a &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; for getting through the stuff I need to get through. They thus provide a kind of extrinsic motivation where my intrinsic motivation has flagged. They also have enough intrinsic interest of their own that I can feel some of that very helpful sense of accomplishing something I care about when I make progress on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that these things fit the profile I described, though: easy to move forward in small chunks of time, and okay to take a long while to finish. The danger with these–even more than with the first kind of small tasks I suggested–is that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; so interesting, and you have to make sure you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still get your regular work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 3. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find ways to gain a sense of &lt;em&gt;momentum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is in some ways the hardest of these, because it’s just digging in deeper on the slog of the project in question–but it’s also the one that most directly gets you closer to the end of the project. The trick is to find a rhythm where you actually move meaningfully closer to the goal of &lt;em&gt;finishing the project&lt;/em&gt; all the time, while not ending up bogged down in nothing but slogs along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of this is figuring out how to break up the project into smaller and more tractable pieces, and then alternating the various elements of it in such a way that you can continually feel the satisfaction of finishing things. Over the last two weeks at work, despite some pretty significant frustrations which made it really hard to do this, I came out with more of a sense of momentum than I had even before those frustrations came up–precisely because I actually knocked out the things we aimed to get done in that specific span of time. And we’re in a spot where we’re actually about to go live with the first meaningful chunk of what we’ve been building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping that sense of momentum is really important. Even when you’re looking at a 6-month stretch of not-that-interesting a set of work ahead of you, it helps to see yourself chipping away at it and making real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 4. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just watch &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sl9pTDK8PAk"&gt;this sequence from Doctor Who Series 9&lt;/a&gt; over and over again.&lt;/strong&gt; Or better yet, the whole episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sl9pTDK8PAk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that’s a hell of a bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note: I’m signing out of all social media until June 11. I’m on vacation from work for a week, and I’m taking the opportunity to enjoy the mental silence of not being on Twitter, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Slack instance, etc. (I may or may not be posting here along the way, but my feeling right now is that I &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

How can you improve your answer to that question?
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I try to take into account when I’m &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/how-i-write-a-talk.html" title="How I Write a Talk"&gt;writing a talk&lt;/a&gt; is how the talk will work for people who cannot see well or at all. It’s easy, when you have good vision, to simply assume that everyone else does, too. But there are lots of ways that assumption falls over—everything from protanopia (the most common form of color-blindness) to total blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a question here that you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; keep in mind when it comes to slides: Is my talk comprehensible without the slides? Because the reality is that some people simply cannot see them. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a helpful way of thinking about it: however you actually go about building and rehearsing your talk, think about its content like a podcast episode. If someone can’t rip the audio out of the video stream, upload it to their podcast player, and follow along without any issue whatsoever… you’re leaning too hard on your slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this quite sharply by two things in the last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; rip the audio from a couple talks and upload it to my podcast player and listen to them while walking and running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk at a meetup that involved some live-demoing/coding and I was thinking afterward: had anyone in the room been hard of sight or unsighted, they could not have followed much of what I said at all. No one was (to my knowledge!) but it had me thinking about how I would solve for that were it otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: think hard about making sure people in the audience who can’t see your slides can still follow your talk.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know, I know: I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/writing-plans-for-the-rest-of-2018.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; you wouldn’t be seeing many blog posts here. But I also said I wouldn’t be able to resist. And it’s Saturday! And I have &lt;em&gt;thoughts&lt;/em&gt;. So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted last week, &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/vacation-as-helpful-reminder.html"&gt;taking a vacation&lt;/a&gt; can provide helpful reminds to us. Not just, as I noted there, about our own role in our teams. Also about the importance and goodness of rest, and the way that we are better able to accomplish the good of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; when we also rightly pursue the good of &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took four half days. That was it. Not an extremely long or even a total vacation. But the difference it made… This week, I &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than made up for those half days in productivity, both at work and in my side projects.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what I’ve just written could be taken as a way of instrumentalizing rest: “Rest is good &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it makes us better at working.” That’s not it. It’s rather that when we rest appropriately because rest is a good and necessary element of the design of human beings, we also find that we flourish in the other aspects of our lives. &lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt; goods in our lives are simultaneously interrelated; and you cannot pursue one of those goods merely &lt;em&gt;for the sake&lt;/em&gt; of another, failing to recognize it as a good in its own right, or usually you will end up getting &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick note on what you can expect here over the next few months: mostly, not much that isn’t technical, and not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much of that. I suggested &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/intentional-cyclicality.html" title="Intentional Cyclicality (March 6, 2018)"&gt;a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt; that it’s worth intentionally carving out different phases for different things, and I’m intentionally carving out a phase that’s lighter on blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mapped out a pretty aggressive schedule for &lt;a href="https://newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; to hit some (mostly but not entirely self-imposed) goals and deadlines—on which I’m &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; behind.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As such, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my writing time needs to be dedicated to that through roughly September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not going to change &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; even after that, because I have a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; writing project I’ll be starting work on in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that you won’t get occasional blog posts on ethics and theology and so on. I don’t think I could stop myself from blogging that way from time to time if I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to. But it won’t be the focus, and if things are relatively quiet around here for much of the rest of the year, don’t worry… you know why!&lt;/p&gt;

I wish I hadn’t.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ended up spending about half an hour on Twitter this morning, a fair bit of it writing out tweets in response to things I’d bumped into. This is not a thing I do often, especially anymore. (There was a time, back in the days of App.net, when I spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time conversing in a Twitter-like context.) And as I was thinking on it afterwards, I realized why I don’t often do it anymore: I come away from it dissatisfied. I’d have been &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; happier working on the blog post I had started before opening Twitter (for something related to that post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is an interesting medium, but I consistently find that if I attempt to have conversations on Twitter—especially about important topics—I come away frustrated with my inability to say clearly what I mean, and concerned by the very real possibility of being misunderstood by someone who has too little of the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Twitter is like standing in the middle of the largest party on earth and &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;shouting at the top of your lungs&lt;/span&gt; to the person next to you. What you’re saying might make total sense in the context of that specific conversation, and if you could explain the context would make sense to the other people in the room, and yet be open to wild and massive misinterpretation or misunderstanding. Worse, because you are &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;shouting at the top of your lungs&lt;/span&gt; (not to mention limited in the weirdest way to 280-character blurbs strung together into something only vaguely resembling coherence), it’s difficult to communicate well even to the person you’re talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote early this year that we should all &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/tweet-less-blog-more.html"&gt;tweet less and blog more&lt;/a&gt; and I was reminded forcefully of that. Tweetstorms are worse than blog posts. The fact that more people are apt to interact with them is a &lt;em&gt;downside&lt;/em&gt;, not an &lt;em&gt;upside&lt;/em&gt;, because people are apt to interact with your least articulate, least coherent, least contextualized version of an idea, and they’re encouraged by the medium to respond to it with snappy comebacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite at the point where I want to just get off of Twitter entirely—but I’m not far from it either. I have no longer any desire to &lt;em&gt;converse&lt;/em&gt; there, and find decreasing profit in reading anything there but links to interesting essays or blog posts. I’m seriously considering using it as a write-only medium and just piping the users with the highest signal of interesting links &lt;a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2018/01/11/feedbin-is-the-best-way-to-read-twitter/" title="“Feedbin is the Best Way to Read Twitter”"&gt;right into my &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt; feed&lt;/a&gt; and having done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

Where do I want to go, and what do I want to do, over the next 5–10 years?</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a bit, for the last year or so, about my &lt;em&gt;career trajectory&lt;/em&gt;. Where do I want to go, and what do I want to do, over the next 5–10 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first seven years or so of my working life, I was just learning everything I could in software, following my interests but without much of a conscious plan, and making sure I put food on the table for my family. And I think that was absolutely the right tack to take! I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; learn a ton, across a relatively wide swath of the industry. I have worked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a cog in megacorporation with over 100,000 employees, writing C targeting a real-time operating system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as the sole dedicated software developer in a company where I was the 12th employee, maintaining decades-old Fortran and C and C++ and writing a fair bit of Python in a scientific computing and physics modeling context;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a subcontractor for a small consultancy doing PHP and jQuery and (both My- and Postgre)SQL;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a solo consultant on projects ranging from WordPress setups to building a small but non-trivial application front-to-back in JavaScript;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, most lately, at a VC-funded startup in the very-tricky scale-up phase, writing JavaScript, TypeScript, and a smidge of C&lt;sup&gt;♯&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve seen nearly every part of the stack to some degree—from writing a lex/yacc parser spike for a one-off assembly language to building rich browser client applications—and I’ve seen a lot of the kinds of companies that exist in our industry. I’ve also seen (and created!) a pretty remarkable amount of tech debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which means that, at 30 (almost 31!) and about a year from the end of my first decade in this industry, I’m starting to have a pretty good sense of the things I like, the things I don’t, and some of the directions I might like to go in the future.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It actually feels a little odd, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I just went where my interests and reasonably good opportunities appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also important. I know better now than I did a decade ago the things that bring me joy and the places where I’m best equipped to contribute effectively to a team. (I am of course also far better equipped to contribute effectively to a team than I was when I started!) I find that I care enormously about what to build as well as how to build it—my instincts and interests seem to be roughly 25% product person, 25% mentor and teacher, and 50% individual contributor, with a particular interest in building enabling tools for others.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea where that will take me in the future, and I’m working closely with my (really excellent) manager at Olo to find ways to both use and develop those effectively where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two upshots to all of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a young developer (or, &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt;, early on in almost any field), getting as varied—but not shallow!—experience you can in the early years is incredibly valuable. That goes double if you’re coming in from a “non-traditional” background as I did, because it’s a great way to get exposed practically to a lot of the different parts of software and to computer science ideas you won’t if you stay in just one spot. That’s obviously a hard luxury to come by in some ways, but if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manage it, it pays huge dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to be starting to have a sense of &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;trajectory&lt;/em&gt;. I’m in the early stages of that, though; I’m curious to see what I sort out in conversation with Jaimie and my church community and others I trust, as well as my leadership at Olo, over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a bunch of thoughts about thinking and memory on my mind over the last decade, and have never really spent a lot of time writing them down. Jaimie has gotten to hear most of them, for good or ill. But Sacasas covers a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of the most important pieces of it in &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2011/09/15/dont-offload-your-memory-quite-yet-cognitive-science-memory-and-education/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and others linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we tend to conceive of thinking analogously to how we imagine a computer works and we abstract processes from data. We treat “critical thinking” as a process that can be taught independently of any specific data or information. On the contrary, according to Willingham, the findings of cognitive science suggest that “[c]ritical thinking processes are tied to background knowledge” and “we must ensure that students acquire background knowledge parallel with practicing critical thinking skills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the chief ways I feel the bitter sting of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/" title="Nick Carr: “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”"&gt;“the shallows”&lt;/a&gt; is in precisely this: that I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; too often let Google do the work my memory should. But memory and connection and those startling leaps of insight that come from them are not substitutable by a search engine. Thinking happens as much in the background of the rest of our lives as it does on demand; and &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answers to questions come as we put questions &lt;em&gt;to ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, rather than to a database, even one powered by sophisticated sets of derivatives (a.k.a. “machine learning”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases are potentially very useful tools. But their utility is specific, and we should circumscribe our uses of them, and especially our reliance on them, accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… read Sacasas on memory!&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing new, just working hard at practicing what we already think. We’ve been “in the trenches” with our three-year-old a bit, because, well… she’s three! Being three is hard! You have an absurd amount you’re learning, and sometimes it breaks your brain! And so being the parent of a three-year-old is also hard.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot recently about how we discipline our children. Nothing &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;, just working hard at practicing what we already think. We’ve been “in the trenches” with our three-year-old a bit, because, well… she’s three! Being three is hard! You have an absurd amount you’re learning, and sometimes it breaks your brain! And so being the parent of a three-year-old is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last several days, I’ve been working very hard to help Kate listen and obey. That way of putting it is intentional and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my observation, the default tendency in conservative Christian circles is to respond to disobedience and willfulness with direct consequences, &lt;em&gt;stat&lt;/em&gt;. There is usually a good motivation behind this, too. We recognize that learning to listen and obey is good and necessary! We don’t want to make the mistake of letting our kids go un-disciplined and so untrained in things they need to be trained in. That said, the extremely common notion that our kids should be immediately given a &lt;em&gt;consequence&lt;/em&gt; of some sort if they don’t “obey the first time, right away, with a happy heart” seems to me profoundly misguided—more than that, profoundly out of step with the way God “parents” his people in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve often remarked to Jaimie as we’ve considered parenting that if we actually look closely at God’s treatment of his people as our model, it doesn’t look &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; like the “obey immediately or receive a consequence” model. To the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s review: God saves Israel from slavery and makes a covenant with them. The terms of that covenant are such that if they violate it, God is within his rights in the terms of the covenant to send them into exile—to remove them from the land he gave them. And in the &lt;em&gt;first generation&lt;/em&gt;, they flagrantly disobey and violate the terms of the covenant. So, game over, right? Off to exile you go! Well… no. God warns, and then disciplines (in the context of national-level consequences!) mildly, and quickly restores when his people cry for help. Over and over again, for 500–700 years, or somewhere between 15 and 25 generations. And many parts of his law they seem &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; to have kept—the Jubilees, for example. God’s patience is astounding. He is, as Exodus 34 puts it, &lt;em&gt;slow to anger and abounding in covenant love&lt;/em&gt;. This isn’t a lack of discipline. But it is extraordinary patience and grace, amazing time devoted to teaching the people how to walk with him even as they got it wrong again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m going to parent in a way that points my kids toward God, that helps them genuinely trust Christ, then my parenting ought to be shaped by all of that. I ought to be slow to anger and abounding in love. I ought to be patient and gracious. I ought to aim not merely to either get the desired behavior or immediately mete out a consequence, but to teach my kids &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do what they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the past few days, I have been working (again! This is not new; we just forget) to help our three-year-old listen and obey. When she does not listen, I get her attention again and remind her that she needs to listen and obey—not least because it’s sometimes very important that she do so! (If we’re outside and near a street and she starts to wander into the road…) And if she still does not listen and obey, I will get down on my knees right in front of her, and look her right in the eyes on her own level, and make her repeat after me exactly what I’ve said. And if she &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t listen, yes, I will give her a consequence for that, to help her learn: that sin has consequences, and so that listening and obeying &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; important to her. But when she does listen—even if it takes all that repetition!—we celebrate with her and give her a high five or a hug or both. Again: so that she learns that doing well is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and that there is a reward for doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That act of getting down on my knees and helping her obey is good for me, too. It’s a concrete action that reminds me: this is a little &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, made in the image of God, who is struggling to keep his commands. She is just like me. More: I can be in that moment a little picture to her, to myself, and to my family of God the Son, who came down to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; level in a way that far outstrips a father getting down on his knees. I cannot save my three-year-old from her sin and her death; I can only point her to the one who does. But that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do. I can remind her, not only with my words (important though they are!) but also with what I do with my body, of the one who loved us enough to bear with us along the way and to bear in himself the cost of our failings.&lt;/p&gt;

(I’ve been steadily pushing forward on &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-typings/issues/14"&gt;a big “quest”-style issue for an open source software project I help maintain&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s how I planned to spend my writing time today.) But I’m feeling quite keenly the need of some time away from that project and indeed from a lot of the things that have had me burning the candle at both ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noted before that I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/intentional-cyclicality.html"&gt;go in cycles&lt;/a&gt;; one thing that I’ve also started to notice is that those cycles, unsurprisingly, include points where I’m just &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. I’m all out of steam. And I seem to have hit one of those just this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense: since last October, as a family we’ve moved across the country; lived with my parents for three months, during which time we learned that my dad had brain cancer and helped him and my mom through the surgery, recovery, and early parts of chemo and radiation); then moved into a new house; and joined a new church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that I’ve personally continued working on &lt;a href="https://newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, helped ship the most important release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript"&gt;ember-cli-typescript&lt;/a&gt; in the project’s history, taught a workshop on TypeScript at EmberConf, and helped kick off one of the most important front-end development projects in Olo’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I’m tired. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I feel like I’m just out of steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick, for the moment, is that there are some things I really feel I should carry to some specific points &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I take a week or two off. Getting that quest issue that I was going to be writing this morning done, and a related &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs"&gt;Ember.js RFC&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship of TypeScript and Ember.js, and getting the first of our beta releases for this project at Olo out the door… all of those are things that really just &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to happen before I take that time off. After I get through those, though, I think I’m taking a week or so off. Maybe time it with Memorial Day to make it a full 10 days or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the meantime, I do things like write little blog posts thinking about “running out of steam” not because it’s all that important for the world to know, but because it’s a way of keeping &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; degree of forward momentum, continuing to maintain my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html"&gt;daily writing habit&lt;/a&gt;, and generally doing all the little things that make it possible for me to actually get across the finish line on those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because—weird though it may seem in some ways—even when I’m tired like it, I know through long experience that the way I actually get across those finish lines is by keeping up my forward motion. It’s very much like the feeling in the last 5k of a half marathon. (A half marathon is two five-milers and a 5k, and thinking about it that way is the way to run it effectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything hurts. You don’t feel like you have anything left. But in fact, if you’ve done the right things up to that point, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have enough left. The way to finish well is not only to keep putting one foot in front of the other, but also to push a little harder, and a little harder, and a little harder, until you hit the finish line. You have to watch out, of course, and not hurt yourself. That’s the trick with mental fatigue, too. Burnout is a real thing. But, as with running, if you’ve built up your mental muscles well and built up the reserves of &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; that you need, you know the difference. You know when you need to stop early for a day and go read a novel. You know when to push through. You know when to take a day off of the quest issue and write a quirky, and not-all-that-coherent, blog post about the experience of fatigue and thinking about pushing on. And you know that you still need to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Giving a good talk is mostly a matter of &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; a good talk and crafting a coherent presentation of that material (with or without slides or other helpers). In this post, I’m going to briefly walk through how &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; prepare talks. This process may not work for you at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;; sometimes I read &lt;a href="TODO:%20Chris%20Coyier/CSS%20Tricks"&gt;other people’s talk preparation strategies&lt;/a&gt; and laugh because they’re so wildly different from mine. But this way there’s one more strategy documented out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is the one I’ve developed over the past few years as I’ve given a couple conference talks and a bunch more weekly tech talks at Olo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my own approach here has a couple details that are technical, the vast majority of it is applicable to any kind of talk. In fact, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of this is essentially identical to certain phases of my preparation for preaching a sermon or teaching a theology class at church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="brainstorm-on-paper." class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Brainstorm on paper.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start by writing out a bunch of different approaches I might want to use for the talk with pen and paper. Usually I grab the &lt;a href="https://us.moleskine.com/en/"&gt;Moleskine&lt;/a&gt; I dedicate to writing ideas&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Juice-Up-Gel-Pen-0.4-mm-Blue-Black/pd/18166"&gt;my favorite pen&lt;/a&gt; and put away everything electronic. Here I’m not worried about structure or organization at all. I just jot down the things I want to cover, what the motivating idea and main takeaway is, and any secondary points I want the audience of the talk to come away with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this is broadly obvious because I already know how to come at the talk. Sometimes it takes multiple passes to get right. And when I skip this step, things go wrong regardless. I almost gave a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; terrible version of an important internal tech talk at Olo a month ago because I hadn’t take the time to do this, and ultimately had to push back when I delivered it by a bunch as a result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="write-a-high-level-outline-and-map-out-the-overall-timing." class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Write a high-level outline and map out the overall timing.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have a good idea the way I want to tackle the subject, I write an outline—again, in my Moleskin with a pen. Once I map out the overall sections of the talk, one or two or &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rarely three layers deep, I go through and write out how long I think each section should be. This is often the first point I have to start cutting material, because I can look at a list of eight sub-bullet points allocated to a 10-minute block and realize: &lt;em&gt;no, I’m probably not actually going to get through that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/emberconf-notes.jpg" title="EmberConf notes" alt="Planning and transferring notes for EmberConf" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Planning and transferring notes for EmberConf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="draft-the-talk-writing-it-out-long-form." class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Draft the talk, writing it out long-form.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the longest part of the process, but it works wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start by copying the outline from my paper notebook into a &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;-friendly writing environment.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I turn each bullet point in the original outline into a heading. Then I expand the outline dramatically, from those high-level sections to slide-level sections: one sub-heading per slide. At this point I also add “breaks” between all the headings, which is how &lt;a href="https://revealjs.com/"&gt;the web-based slides tool I use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I script the talk in detail. I know some people just throw down bullet points here; that’s not how I work. I write out a word-by-word script for what to say. Each of those headings/slides gets anything from a sentence to a few paragraphs. As I’m doing this, I keep an eye on the word count: courtesy of having done a fair number of talks this way, and having done a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; this way, I have a pretty good feel for what a given number of words will come out to in terms of talk time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the phase where I extract bullet points, notes about images to insert, code samples, etc. Sometimes I’ll pause to write out an example in detail while working on the script; other times I’ll just leave myself a note that looks like &lt;code&gt;TODO: add Doctor Who &amp;quot;Oh yes!&amp;quot; GIF here&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/507/438/eeb.gif"&gt;For reference: &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; GIF.&lt;/a&gt; The script goes behind a simple textual marker (customizable in the tool I use; usually just &lt;code&gt;Note:&lt;/code&gt;) so that it doesn’t show up on the slide and instead is displayed as speaker notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing for me is that writing out the talk this way lets me know what materials actually go on what slides, and it also cements the content into my mind. Once it’s written, I don’t actually try to memorize it, and I don’t read from it while delivering the talk. The act of creating it this way makes the flow of the slides flow coherently. I end up with a map to what I actually intend to say in the form of the slides themselves—so they guide me and the audience together through the content in a coherent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have this full script written out, I’ll go back over it as a revision pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="do-a-dry-run-and-edit-the-talk." class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Do a dry-run and edit the talk.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now do at least one dry run for every conference-type talk—by myself in front of the computer if necessary, but preferably in front of at least a small audience. A dry run has two big upsides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figure out whether I’m going to hit your time or not. I take this really seriously, because I think it’s incredibly rude to both the audience and (if you’re not going last) the next speaker to go over. So if I need to trim, I figure that out by doing a dry run (and probably not any other way). Even with all my practice prepping spoken materials, I still have to tweak and trim for length quite regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get to have a feedback cycle with the actual process of presenting the material—from yourself if nothing else, but possibly also from the audience if I have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve only gotten to do a dry run with an audience twice (for my Rust Belt Rust talk and for the EmberConf workshop I just gave), but it has been incredibly helpful both times. Having people give you feedback on what you’ve just presented can be slightly intimidating, but it’s way better to learn that the flow was off in an important way &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you give a talk than &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write down the feedback I get in a dry run, or I take notes if I’m doing it by myself, and then I use those to update the script and slides I prepared in step 3 to resolve any issues I ran into. That often means cutting material; in the case of my EmberConf workshop it also meant completely restructuring part of the talk—moving the order of material around a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. That was a lot of work, but it was also incredibly important and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this in practice, you can see the whole final content of my EmberConf 2018 workshop &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriskrycho/emberconf-slides/master/talk.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;—you can see it’s just plain text and some special markup for certain slide transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="repeat-step-4-until-im-happy-with-it-or-im-out-of-time." class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Repeat Step 4 until I’m happy with it or I’m out of time.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest: it’s usually the latter, and in many ways that’s actually a good thing. A talk can be polished &lt;em&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt; and it’s not actually helpful to polish forever. At some point the return on investment is so small relative to the time cost (which is high!) that you should just stop and give the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;or occasionally a white, narrow-ruled legal pad&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now that’s usually &lt;a href="TODO"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, but there are things that bother me about every such writing app I’ve ever tried—and yes, before you suggest it, that does include Emacs and Vim, along with VS Code and other programming text editors, as well as the usual plain-text writing environment apps like Ulysses.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It does us all a great disservice, not for what it says but for what it leaves unsaid and the ways it misleads us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I most recently ran into the &lt;em&gt;capitalism&lt;/em&gt; variant of the phrase in the influential 1995 essay “The Californian Ideology,” by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron. The text is littered with the phrase; if you took the essay at face value you would conclude that at least in the minds of Barbrook and Cameron capitalism had transformed from a system and structure into a demon, possessing and directing the culture they dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not opposed to &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/matthewloftus/2017/04/27/new-gods-old-demons/" title="Matthew Loftus: “New Gods, Old Demons”"&gt;such readings of the world&lt;/a&gt; in principle; I think they may even &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/04/principalities-powers-and-technical-boy.html" title="Alan Jacobs: “principalities, powers, and the technical boy”"&gt;get certain important things right&lt;/a&gt; that we too often overlook in our “disenchanted” modernity. If people want to talk of Capitalism and Marxism and Media and Liberalism and Technologism and The Beltway and The Kremlin and so on as capital-P Powers—if people want to think about the ways in which there may be real spiritual realities at work behind some of the things we take for granted—well, as the millennials say, &lt;em&gt;I am so here for that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not how Barbrook and Cameron meant it. Nor is it how most people mean the phrase when they toss it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they mean, instead, is something like this: &lt;em&gt;People act differently in different systems and structures; the system and structure of capitalism [or liberalism or fundamentalism or…] leads people to act in [this way that I think is bad].&lt;/em&gt; It is, in other words, shorthand for an idea most of us can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That idea is important, too: people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act differently in different systems and structures. What’s more, when a given structure is pervasive, it can be difficult to resist or reject, or even to consider that it should be resisted or rejected. This idea is so important that &lt;a href="http://stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; and I dedicated all of &lt;a href="https://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html"&gt;Winning Slowly Season 5: Structure and Agency&lt;/a&gt; to the ins and outs of systems and structures, good and bad alike; the limits of individual action in the face of systemic pressure; and the ways we ought to leverage good systems and dismantle bad systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. As much as this shorthand captures something important, it also &lt;em&gt;obscures&lt;/em&gt; something important: it is &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; who act differently under those different structures, and &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; who set up systems in the first place and maintain them afterward. This is not to dismiss the tendency of systems to perpetuate themselves, or to ignore the reality of systems which harm everyone in them and go on existing anyway. (Self interest is complicated.) Rather, it is to remind us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; systems come to be (people created them because they seemed in some way good to them), &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are made of (people continuing to do what seems in some way good to them), and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are hard to dismantle (because many people’s self-interest is aligned with maintaining existing institutions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to think and act as if individual agency is all that matters, and this is fallacious. People &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act differently in different systems and structures, for good and for ill. Capitalism, as a system and structure, serves as an environment in which enormous gains in productivity have been possible; but it also serves an environment where people reduce others (and themselves) to their productivity. “Liberalism,” as a system and structure, serves as an environment where many important gains in human liberties have grown up; but it also serves as an environment where the good of liberty has at times grown cancerous and indeed metastasized until the will of the individual is dangerously (and nonsensically) totalized. Contrast how people live and think and act in capitalist or liberal contexts with feudal or tribal contexts (to pick just two of the many contrasts we could) and you will see very, very different things. Systems matter; we cannot erase their impact on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is also possible to talk and act as if the structure, the system, is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. This is the mistake the shorthand “what capitalism does” leads us to. Flip the emphasis in the previous paragraph: the environments of capitalism and liberalism matter, but &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; continue to act in those environments. More than that, people continue to transform the structures and systems they inhabit, often in startling ways. Half a century ago, it would have been laughable to suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com" title="Apple"&gt;the most profitable corporation in the world&lt;/a&gt; would also be among those most assiduously pursuing environmental responsibility and stewardship. People’s continuous pressure, as well as the ascent to not only economic but also cultural leadership of people who care about this has changed capitalism in a good way. Social pressure on businesses has plenty of downsides, too, in our internet-rage-storm era; and there is much to critique about the ways that business leaders have come to dominate culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point, though, is that systems and structures are more malleable than the shorthand credits them, and so we would do well to remember the limitations of the shorthand and indeed largely to abandon it unless we are often in the habit of qualifying it. It is too sloppy. Throw it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if not that (shorthands &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; useful after all) then clarify often. Talk instead about structures, and systems, and people’s ability to change them—indeed to throw them out. Speak less often of “what capitalism does” and more often of what capitalism makes easy and what it makes hard, what avenues living in liberalism opens up and what it blinds us to, what virtues and what vices fundamentalism might inculcate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you want to have a conversation about Powers, have at it.)&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you look closely at my written output on this site (and indeed on all the previous incarnations of it), you’ll notice a sort of trend: repeating &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/three-month-cycles.html" title="Three Month Cycles. Or something thereabouts."&gt;cycles&lt;/a&gt; of substantial output, usually focused in a particular direction, followed by a period of silence and then, when I start back up, usually a different topic at the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, for example, you can see phases of emphasis on TypeScript and on art, phases where I wrote on a mix including productivity and on programming languages and type theory. But you can also see gaps. Nothing at all appeared here between August and November last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I was reading &lt;a href="http://ayjay.org"&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; at his &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/"&gt;Text Patterns&lt;/a&gt; blog (&lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2018/03/rewriting-ancient-history.html" title="Rewriting Ancient History"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re curious), and thinking on his &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2018/03/back-in-saddle.html" title="Back in the Saddle"&gt;“I’m back!”&lt;/a&gt; post from a few days ago. Since I started reading Jacobs a few years ago, I’ve watched him go through a number of cycles: he’ll simply say “I have other things I need to do now; I have no idea if I’ll pick this specific site back up, but if I do it won’t be for a good long while!” and &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/09/pinboard.html" title="Redirecting to Pinboard"&gt;be on his way&lt;/a&gt;. The site will sit dormant for the better part of a year. And then: “I’m back!” (I doubt Jacobs will ever stop blogging; he seems to find it a fruitful medium &lt;a href="TODO"&gt;for many of the same reasons I do&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought that caught my attention today is what Jacobs got up to in the meantime. My breaks tend to be forced on me by simply running out of steam or getting distracted by &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org/" title="True Myth"&gt;other projects&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobs… writes whole books ranging from the &lt;a href="TODO" title="How to Think: A Guide for the Perplexed"&gt;popular (and important!)&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="TODO" title="The Year of Our Lord 1943: TODO"&gt;academic (and important!)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to why that caught my attention so: I also read &lt;a href="http://stephaniehurlburt.com/"&gt;Stephanie Hurlburt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2018/3/6/what-is-fulfillment" title="What is Fulfillment?"&gt;her most recent post&lt;/a&gt; had me thinking on plans and goals and hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking for a while now about how I accomplish both my day-to-day goals and my longer-term aims. Some of the things I want to do are, like Hurlburt’s bigger goals listed near the end of that post, in the 5–10-year category! Accomplishing some of those kinds of things requires focus, discipline, and time. All of which together suggest the importance of recognizing that the kinds of cycles I have fallen into naturally are not bad things, but that I might be better served by letting my other goals and aims &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; inform how much I blog (rather than its being mere incidental fallout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this later. For now I have a &lt;a href="https://emberconf.com/speakers.html#chris-krycho" title="EmberConf: TypeScript Up Your Ember.js App!"&gt;conference workshop&lt;/a&gt; to finish preparing for and three New Rustacean episodes planned for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yes. I did that on purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;

This has happened to me before. So in trade, here are the couple paragraphs of notes (on one particular failing I see among my fellow conservatives) from the last time this happened to me.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most frustrating things as a writer is when you have a good idea and then &lt;em&gt;forget it&lt;/em&gt;. I had a thought this morning, and it was solid. But I was not in a spot where I could write it down (whether in a notebook or in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;). The frustration I feel at this is hard to express, but here I am trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is such a frustrating experience that I &lt;em&gt;keenly&lt;/em&gt; remember the experience happening to me once before—back in 2016, for a post I have not yet finished writing because I continually find it &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; me. And since I cannot remember today’s good idea, and haven’t finished the last good idea, I’ll just share the notes I wrote down back in March 2016 about that idea in hopes that either I will actually run with them sooner rather than later, or that the act of putting it out there in this brief form will be enough to allow me to let it go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American conservatives point to previous eras as if our nation were less sinful, less blemished then. It was not. It was wretched in different ways—but no less wicked than now. Centuries of slavery, and of Jim Crow, &lt;em&gt;are not lesser sins than today’s sexual ills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have too often elided these essential questions: Whose “better” past? And in what sense “better”? It may have been less sexually perverse, but how is that “better” when it entailed at the same time massive oppression of whole groups of people—especially because that oppression was so often at the hands of people claiming the name of Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal to unpack there, and I continue to find it more than I am really &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twice, recently, I have found myself needing to start over—essentially from scratch—on something I had written. One was a tech talk for work, another my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2017-in-review-my-goals.html" title="2017 In Review: My Goals"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; post on how we chose a new church after we moved across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both pieces suffered from an overabundance of combativeness. Or: I was kind of a jerk in the first drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about them this morning, I noted that in both cases my tendency was to write in a posture that mixed defensiveness with hostility to an existing structure. In both cases, that hostility might actually be well-deserved—but there are times and places for everything, including polemic, and the more I (separately) chewed on both of these pieces, the more I realized that I didn’t want to have an argument. In these cases, at least, I don’t want to &lt;em&gt;punch&lt;/em&gt; the views I disagree with, so much as gently nudge them out of the way while showing a more excellent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runs up against one of my deepest-seated tendencies. I am passionate about teaching, about showing a better way, about correcting and fixing ills in the world. I also find a good argument wonderfully sharpening to the way I think—tracing out differences, finding the weaknesses in my own views and either tightening them up or abandoning them as appropriate, understanding other views more clearly… Those are good passions in many ways, but like all good passions they can go awry very easily. In my case, they can lead me to treat &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; like an argument, and to go after everything that seems amiss to me with the same kind of knock-it-down-with-a-battering-ram approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last fifteen years, I have been learning &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to verbally hammer at problems (whether in person or in writing). I have slowly learned to listen carefully and try to understand why someone holds the view they do, even when I still think their view is wrong. I have seen firsthand that people’s surface statements and their deepest-held beliefs alike often derive from experiences that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; obvious on the surface. Their struggles are not necessarily apparent. Their histories certainly are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also slowly learned that a nudge here and a nudge there can often be both more effective and—more importantly—&lt;em&gt;kinder&lt;/em&gt; than trying to shove people where I think they ought to be. Even when I’m right about where they ought to be! And my judgments of such things, I have also too-slowly learned, are far less than perfect—which should temper the vigor with which I sally forth to do battle for those judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: there are times for rebuke. There are times to say, “This view you hold [about software development, or Christianity, or financial practices, or whatever else]? It’s &lt;em&gt;dead wrong&lt;/em&gt;.” But not all the time. Even though it’s what’s “natural” for me, even though it’s what feels right sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we have to fight our strongest instincts. No matter how natural something feels, it can be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. That is certainly so for me when I get combative about something I’m passionate about. It’s the right response… &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt;. Nearly all of the time, I need to be quieter, gentler, more patient, more understanding, and less interested in winning a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I did in 2017 that I’m most proud of (and which I get &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; utility from every day at work) is building &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt;, a library implementing &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; types in TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: if you’re about to tune out because this sounds technical, don’t. You can understand everything important in this post without understanding a thing about TypeScript or these particular types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; special about that library compared to any of the others in the space which already do the same thing. It makes its own &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth/blob/master/README.md#why-not" title="Comparisons with Folktale and Sanctuary"&gt;design tradeoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which are slightly &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from others, and it has what I think are &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org"&gt;best-in-class docs&lt;/a&gt;, but mostly it’s comparable to the others. Still, it’s &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, and it fits that particular niche in terms of design tradeoffs pretty well in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just saw the public work on that, you’d have first heard of it &lt;em&gt;at the earliest&lt;/em&gt; when I pushed the first commit to GitHub on September 21, 2017. But the roots go much, much further back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I just found a related bit of work dating all the way back to January 10, 2017: an early attempt to see if I could directly reimplement Rust’s Result and Option types in TypeScript, in the early days of my adoption of TypeScript.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That initial spike didn’t work—and I mean that literally; I didn’t yet have enough of a handle on TypeScript’s type system to get it to actually compile! But it was the first of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; (mostly very brief) swings I took at it over the course of the year. The culmination of those repeated stabs at the problem was True Myth, with its polish, test coverage, and very considered design tradeoffs.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But none of that would have happened without the better part of a year of experimenting along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more: even that January spike wasn’t the real start of True Myth. I have code in our codebase (code we’re finally mostly done replacing with True Myth!) that was an early attempt to capture these same basic ideas in plain-old JavaScript—code that dates to March 2016!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: do not be discouraged when your own work seems to take a long time, or when you see others produce what seem to be fully-formed projects all in a rush. Always, our best work stands on a foundation—of ideas simmering over time, of previous attempts that got partway, of previous outright &lt;em&gt;failures&lt;/em&gt;—and all of that is “underground,” out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat amusingly to me in retrospect, I’d switched from Flow to TypeScript on our codebase at Olo as my final act of 2016.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that we hit a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sweet spot with the design here: it works well as idiomatic JavaScript &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; supports nice functional idioms and I think it just feels nice to use &lt;em&gt;in JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;—not just as a port of ideas from Haskell, Scala, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So: open-source software, Twitter and blogging, word vomit, and reading widely and deeply.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a meander. I have a bunch of mostly-unformed thoughts, and I want to write, and the two come out here, together, in the next few minutes before I start my workday proper (because I stayed up late last night working on open source software and got up late accordingly, and so have a great deal less of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="“Knowing Your Rhythms”"&gt;my normally-allocated writing time&lt;/a&gt; available today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a very strange place, and the dynamics of it favor those of us who already have well-paying jobs and lots of flexibility in our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing. It means that anyone who wants to use open-source contribution as a gauge of someone’s fitness to work is making a pretty foolish decision, though: they’re inherently cutting off a whole sector—dare I say it, a whole &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;—of people who simply do not (and, barring being given a pretty surprising break, will never) have that kind of stability and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad for meaningful discussion. I follow both &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/noahpinion"&gt;Noah Smith (@noahpinion)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky"&gt;Lyman Stone (@lymanstoneky)&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re both extremely interesting follows, and they’re both clearly &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; smart and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well-informed, and in their off-Twitter writing they both do a good job of fairly representing others’ views and interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, their arguments are a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specific to Smith and Stone. This is Twitter in one pair of interlocutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously: stop tweeting and start blogging again, if you have an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; to make rather than just a pithy, one-off observation or a link to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a surprising amount of writing done in 5 minutes, if you’re willing to just word-vomit. (This whole post, start to finish, took me 12 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more poetry; more rich, good fiction; more rich, good nonfiction. I’ve read a lot of nonfiction in the last five years, but I wouldn’t call most of it &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;. Most of it—most of my seminary reading, that is—was &lt;em&gt;just okay&lt;/em&gt;; very little of it engaged deeply with thought critical of its own perspective. (Major exceptions: David Koyzis’ really excellent &lt;em&gt;Political Visions and Illusions&lt;/em&gt;, Alvin Plantinga’s &lt;em&gt;Where the Conflict Really Lies&lt;/em&gt;, and of course St. Athanasius’ &lt;em&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find that my own writing is far sharper, clearer, and better when I’m drawing &lt;em&gt;widely&lt;/em&gt; and from &lt;em&gt;deep wells&lt;/em&gt;. Widely, because I find that too much time in the same spot overly narrows my focus, whether that is apologetics or programming languages. From deep wells because, frankly, there is too much out there which warrants nothing more than a skim &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all!&lt;/p&gt;

The point is faithfully doing the right things, and doing them for love of God and love of neighbors.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Americans overrate &lt;em&gt;productivity&lt;/em&gt;. We emphasize it at the expense of nearly everything else. That goes for the most individual evaluations to the structures and decisions of megacorporations. Our goal is to extract every last bit of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; from ourselves we can. And this is, in a word, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. It is bad not because work is bad, but because it is a good thing become the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing. (This is the usual way humans mess things up: we take good things and make them ultimate, when nothing we make or do can bear that weight.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given all of that, why do I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/productivity/" title="Posts tagged “Productivity”"&gt;think and write so much about productivity&lt;/a&gt;? Put plainly, because I think the goods of creation and production are still worth pursuing, and I want to steward my time well accordingly. I want to create the things I am passionate about—from blog posts like this to &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com" title="New Rustacean"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org" title="Winning Slowly"&gt;episodes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://olo.com" title="Olo – online ordering for restaurants"&gt;the web apps I build&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript" title="Ember CLI TypeScript"&gt;the supporting tools&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth" title="True Myth"&gt;I work on&lt;/a&gt;—without that overwhelming the other things in my day. I think about productivity the way I do, in other words, because I want to be productive without productivity becoming an idol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put more directly: my efforts on the many projects I care about &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; come at the expense of loving my family well, serving my church, spending meaningful amounts and kinds of time with friends, and so on. There are many goods in this life we are responsible to pursue. That’s not the usual way we think about good things in life either: we tend to think about good things as things we &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to pursue, if we have time after our other less-good responsibilities. But I think that’s a misshapen view of the kinds of things I’m talking about here. Worship, family life, work, creative expression, service, teaching: these are all goods we are &lt;em&gt;called to&lt;/em&gt; (to various degrees, given the qualifiers of gifting and circumstances).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore ought to think of them in terms of faithfulness. Do we do each of them to the best of our abilities, making good use of our time and abilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that consideration plays itself out in a variety of ways. One making sure that when I am working, I am working &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.esv.org/Colossians+3+23/" title="Colossians 3:23"&gt;doing my work well, honoring God in the doing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/log-all-the-things.html" title="Log All the Things!"&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; is a tool to that end. It, being a tool, can also be put to other, worse ends, of course: it could very well become a means to obsession with work! But my goal with it is simply to steward my time and attention well, in part so that I may have attention to pay—for attention is indeed &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/04/79-theses-on-technology-the-spectrum-of-attention/" title="79 Theses on Technology: The Spectrum of Attention"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-on-attention/" title="79 Theses on Technology: On Attention"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/04/79-theses-on-technology-jacobs-responds-to-wellmon/" title="79 Theses on Technology: Jacobs Responds to Wellmon"&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt;—in other, &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2011/03/22/dont-worry-be-idle/" title="Don’t Worry, Be Idle"&gt;less “productive”&lt;/a&gt; but no less deeply important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, setting aside this hour for writing every morning enables me to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; more and better in the ways I need to for the sake of faithful stewardship of my own God-given gifts and desires, and (no less importantly) for the sake of using those gifts and desires for the good of my community.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If I am unable to so much as muster a coherent thought because I’ve waited to do my writing until a time of day when I simply cannot think in that manner, then I am unable to use this combination of desire and ability for the glory of God and the good of my neighbors. But if I, aware of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms"&gt;my bodily and intellectual rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, allocate an hour in the morning to write and an hour of lower concentration for e.g. taking a run in the silence of the empty winter fields near here, then I am able to both be productive when I ought to, and idle when I ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity,” then, as I conceive it &lt;em&gt;whenever&lt;/em&gt; I write about it here, is not an ultimate end. Having (and making good use of!) a to-do list, for example, is not about maximizing the number of things I can do in a given week. It is about carrying out my many vocations well, and not failing to do the things I ought. Your set of vocations looks different from mine. The set of things you ought not fail to do is different accordingly. And the tools you employ may be different: for reasons of phase of life, temperament, abilities, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity” as such is not the point. The point is faithfully doing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; things, and doing them for love of God and love of neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cf. Augustine, _Confessions_, Book 1, paragraph 1.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of this list is important, though it is perhaps also misleading: worship undergirds and shapes the others.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That passage was addressed to people in legal slavery (albeit a slavery very different in kind from the chattel slavery of the American South). I’m not here going to dig more deeply into the hermeneutics of applying it to someone doing labor in a market economy; suffice it to say I think that if a first century slave should work hard so as to honor God in his or her work, so ought we.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our desires and aims are not for ourselves. They’re meant to be gifts to those around us; used rightly, they can be.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/947607650484740098"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested 2018 resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚡️ Tweet less. Blog more. ⚡️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll make all of our discourse better and richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m going to trace out how I plan to do that, in hopes that it’ll help others write (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/947694285004201984"&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt;!) more blog posts—short posts, long posts, and everything in between. In another post (probably tomorrow or Thursday), I’ll explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I think this is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweet less.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re tempted to string together more than two or &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt; three tweets… you have a blog post. Seriously! At 280 characters, if you assume a word is roughly 5 characters on average, and toss in spaces and punctuation, you’ve got 40–45 words in a tweet. Three of those is 120–130 words. Five tweets is 200–225 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down your ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a &lt;code&gt;#writing/ideas&lt;/code&gt; tag in &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8" title="Bear by Shiny Frog on the App Store"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and new ideas I have just get thrown in there. When I have a day where I don’t have some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; specific idea to tackle, I browse through that list and grab something that seems interesting. As an example: my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html"&gt;“Chrome is Not the Standard”&lt;/a&gt; post had just been sitting in there for a couple months when I finally got around to writing it up a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay with being brief.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a wordy guy, but I think many people feel the need to write &lt;em&gt;much longer&lt;/em&gt; material now than they did in the early days of blogging, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; Twitter exists. It’s as if the existence of a microblogging platform makes us feel like a 200-word post doesn’t justify its own existence. I don’t believe that: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html" title="Momentum"&gt;I write short posts sometimes!&lt;/a&gt; And some of &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/"&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/many-ways-learn/"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; regularly do likewise.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay taking a while to finish.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes a piece can take a few weeks (or months!) to gel. That’s okay. Keep at it. Take some of your allocated writing time and keep plugging. That’s how I finally finished &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="“Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins”"&gt;this book review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But finish things.&lt;/strong&gt; That means: get them to a spot where you’re ready to post them (even if they’re not perfect [because they never are!]) or eventually just throw them away. Both are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block out some time for it!&lt;/strong&gt; The main reason for my flurry of posts of late is that &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms"&gt;I started writing every day before 7am&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a habit I’m keeping! It helps. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; scripts. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/four-languages/"&gt;technical writing&lt;/a&gt;. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/star-wars-the-internet-and-me.html" title="Star Wars, the Internet, and Me"&gt;reflections on _Star Wars_&lt;/a&gt;. But blocking out the time means &lt;em&gt;writing will happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I do every year, I’ve been making some goals for myself for 2018. I’m breaking these down into three big categories this year, having learned from the experience of summarizing my goals for last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing aims&lt;/strong&gt;: things that I can’t exactly check off as &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, but which are extremely important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;: things I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; mark as done.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary:&lt;/strong&gt; the most important of my goals—the ones I’ll count myself as having failed in some way if I don’t accomplish them over the course of the year (barring &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; unforeseen goings-on, which are, well… impossible to foresee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;: other goals, which I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to get to, but which it won’t bother me if I don’t get to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section id="standing-aims" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standing aims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate well into our new church—including finding specific ways and places to serve regularly, joining a small group, and making some good friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more, better, and more consistent time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="primary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Primary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship a minimum of 3 episodes of New Rustacean per month January—October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish Winning Slowly Season 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish at least 4 medium-length (2,000–3,500 words) at Mere Orthodoxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ember-cli-typescript “finished”—i.e. with full support for addons and fast incremental builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship a &lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design"&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; version of a major application I work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read, or finish reading, the following books:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resurrection and Moral Order&lt;/em&gt;, Oliver O’Donovan (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology and the Mirror of Scripture&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin Vanhoozer and Daniel Treier (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Buildings Learn&lt;/em&gt;, Stewart Brand (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of God&lt;/em&gt;, Augustine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Technological Society&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of the City&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ethics of Freedom&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blasphemy: A Radical Critique of our Technological Culture&lt;/em&gt;, Ivan Illich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitness:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish the &lt;a href="http://www.childrenscoloradofoundation.org/courage-classic/"&gt;Courage Classic&lt;/a&gt; with my dad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get back to my target/healthiest weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="flexible" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flexible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish one essay at a larger publication (for money, if possible!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive static versions of the prior versions of my website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the page load performance of this site (e.g. with progressive font-loading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make meaningful progress on &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; November–December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a book club at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up to 20 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print hard copies of at least one year of my website archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; to go after this year. One thing that isn’t apparent here is that a fair bit of this is aimed at goals that extend past this year. There are things I want to do in the first half of my thirties if possible, of which some of these are a part. I don’t have those kinds of things written down (and when I write them down, I probably won’t publish them here!) but as I come into the broad swath of life that is just “adulthood”—not &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; adulthood or &lt;em&gt;old age&lt;/em&gt;—I am increasingly mindful of the kinds of things I want to do that take more than a single year to accomplish. Some of these move the needle substantially in that direction, so hopefully I’ll get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As has been my habit for a few years now, I’m taking some time to reflect on the year as it comes to a close. Thinking about how this year went and what I accomplished, and how I would like the next year to go and what I would like to accomplish &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, has become an important part of my life. There is value in taking stock and making plans—as long as you hold those plans loosely. And this particular set of reflections majors on holding plans loosely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start seems to be with a review of my goals for 2017, set out &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html" title="2016 in Review, Part 6: Plans for 2017"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In a post later this week, I’ll write up some thoughts on what I hope to accomplish in 2018—though, as you’ll see, there are some hints of that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note: there are many things going on in our lives that don’t end up in these reflections—because these reflections (as I conceive them at present, at least) are about the kind of public-facing things I did this year. A blog is not a journal, even if there are some analogies between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="major-goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really a thing you can ever call &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; in a real sense; there’s always more to do. But we did it well this year, and better than any previous year. I’m looking forward to building on the foundation we laid this year as we move into 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have much the same to say here as I do about family time. I’ll add that we did move across country and join a new church (and a new denomination!), and I expect to write at much greater length about the convictions which drove the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; we landed on our new congregation after moving across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="4" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shipped a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of code this year, including making some pretty significant architectural contributions for the main app I work on—laying the foundation for it to transition from being a &lt;em&gt;mobile&lt;/em&gt; web application to being a &lt;em&gt;responsive, progressive&lt;/em&gt; web application in 2018. I also built &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt; and made some pretty substantial progress on &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/" title="Typing Your Ember"&gt;TypeScript in Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="5" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt; And, to our surprise relative to the beginning of the year, we’re moving in less than a month from now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="6" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I basically ended up putting Lightning on hold entirely this year. New Rustacean and all of the things we had to do around moving just left me with insufficient time to make any sustained progress on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="minor-goals" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minor goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average… done.&lt;/strong&gt; But only on average. I put out a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more episodes in November and December than any other month, courtesy of the &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/interview/rbr_2017/index.html"&gt;micro-interviews&lt;/a&gt; I conducted at &lt;a href="https://rust-belt-rust.com"&gt;Rust Belt Rust&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the year, I did publish quite a few episodes, but not nearly as many as I would have liked – more like an average of 1–1.5 each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/strong&gt; Winning Slowly did not go &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; the way we thought this year. Our ambitions were… ambitious, given we were both planning to finish graduate degrees and knew that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; Stephen and possibly &lt;em&gt;both of us&lt;/em&gt; would be moving across the country. Total episodes published this year: 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com" title="City of Oaks Marathon"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; The spring ended up busier and, most importantly, more unpredictable schedule-wise than I hoped, and than allowed for sufficiently regular exercise as to be ready for a triathlon in the summer. And our move across the country both eliminated the final six weeks of training I would have needed for the marathon, and also left us 1,800 miles away from the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not sure!&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t done a max set in a few months. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been doing a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups since arriving in Colorado, so… maybe. I’ll edit this in a couple days after I do a max set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadly, not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I have not yet gotten a good handle on what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; dietary changes I’ll need to make to accomplish this goal, but the ones I tried this year didn’t do the trick. I’ll try something new in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done:&lt;/strong&gt; I made a fair bit of progress at the beginning of the year, but this is a &lt;em&gt;mammoth&lt;/em&gt; task. That said, it’s on my radar to try to help drive it forward (hopefully with community involvement) in 2018—it would be great for a complete and accurate reference to be part of the Rust 2019 epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, I fixed the last couple bugs and tightened things down in the implementation of &lt;a href="https://holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;. While there’s a lot—oh is there a lot!—I would do differently now (3 years after I finished the base implementation of the app), I’m really delighted that in the last six months I’ve had exactly zero bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt; this was an intentional choice as we started into the year, because there were a couple other guys who it was more helpful to have in that role for their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; training. I’ve taught a lot over the years, and both of those guys are going to be actively in church-planting roles in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; I published &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/rhythms-family-worship/" title="The Rhythms of Family Worship"&gt;one essay on our family worship&lt;/a&gt; and another (just last week), &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins"&gt;a book review essay&lt;/a&gt; on William T. Cavanaugh and James K. A. Smith’s _Evolution and the Fall_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; expect to tackle this in 2018, but it just ended up not being a high priority in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; Same as with the New Rustacean ebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started, but incomplete.&lt;/strong&gt; I pulled those archives down for the Blogger site, but have yet to do some systematic cleanup on the &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;. (This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; actually happen by the end of the year, depending on what all I do on my week off, but as of the time I’m drafting this, it’s not done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I did get a Linode server configured, on which I’m running our family blog (&lt;a href="https://krycho.com"&gt;krycho.com&lt;/a&gt;), and which I should pretty easily be able to use for other non-static sites going forward. Though, as I’ve thought about it over the last year and change: it’s likely I’ll split it up into a small handful, with one consisting of a kind of “shared hosting” for the various friends’ WordPress blogs I host; and one consisting of my own and my family’s sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="in-summary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year didn’t really go as we thought it would. A lot of that came down to finding a house plan we loved and could build on a lot that we equally loved—it shifted financial and temporal priorities alike. Add in some pretty serious family health issues in my extended family, and, well, no surprise some of my plans and goals didn’t pan out. That’s how it goes! The point of making these kinds of goals, for me, isn’t so much that I accomplish everything on my list as it is taking time to orient myself and to choose what I will and won’t &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; on in the year ahead. And in 2017, I did focus on many of the things on this list. Some of them ended up more important than expected; others less. Interestingly and importantly, though, almost nothing I really spent my time focusing on &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; on the list. And that’s why I keep doing this year after year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m now about two weeks into my new routine of writing every morning. In that time, I’ve managed to (finally!) publish a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins: Cavanaugh and Smith’s Evolution and the Fall"&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; I had been planning to tackle (and had abortively started more than once) for months; I have written almost as many words as I have the whole rest of the year; and I published &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html" title="Chrome is not the Standard"&gt;one post&lt;/a&gt; that apparently &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15980653"&gt;struck a nerve&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that has become obvious is that &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;my initial surmise&lt;/a&gt; was correct: the early morning &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best time for me to be writing, and I get a lot of mileage out of taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little post is a reflection not just on that upside, though, but on rolling with the punches. It’s now 7:30pm, and I didn’t write at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; this morning… because I didn’t sleep much last night. My little sister and her husband are in town with their 7-year-old and 3-week-old… and the 3-week-old, one room over from us, slept about the way 3-week-old babies tend to. Add in a 3:45am call from my wife and kids who had to &lt;a href="http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Fire-forces-evacuation-at-Dallas-Love-Field-465891633.html"&gt;evacuate the airport for a fire alarm&lt;/a&gt; where they were trying to fly home from visiting family, and the need then to drive up to the airport to get them, and my normal writing block simply didn’t exist. So here I am some 13 hours later, trying to just write a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit today anyway, because even after just these couple weeks I have come to value getting out some words every day. After I finish this little post, I’ll see if I can knock out another section of the New Rustacean episode I’m drafting for early January, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity” often looks like this: just a bit at a time, day after day; and doing a little even when you don’t really feel like it, just so you keep some forward motion going. Here’s to a lot of keeping-up-that-momentum in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

I grew up in the prequel era. I spent a decade learning how to be a good citizen of the internet via Star Wars fan forums. If you spoil &lt;cite&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/cite&gt;, I will be angry at you forever.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend and I were talking a few days about an interesting quirk we both share: spoilers are one thing; spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; are something else entirely—something &lt;em&gt;profoundly wrong&lt;/em&gt;. On the one hand, of course, this is silly: spoilers are spoilers; the sentiment is a reflection of our deeper emotional attachment to the Star Wars universe. But it got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own journey with Star Wars has been long and winding. When I was a kid, I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the movies and books—beyond a reasonable enjoyment. I obsessed. For a time it filled all my spare hours.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (And I was homeschooled and smart, so that was a lot of hours.) It eventually became so bad, when I was in sixth grade, that my parents counseled me that I needed to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to change, because it was consuming way too much of my time. I took six months off, and came back able to enjoy the universe—movies, books (and more books!), comics, etc.—without it dominating my mental life as it had before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept reading books and comics through high school and college. Somewhere in late middle school I found fan forums for the LucasArts video games (&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020523141043/http://www.lucasforums.com:80/" title="Internet Archive link"&gt;“LucasForums”, now defunct&lt;/a&gt;) and got my first taste of online interaction—I “took my first step into a larger world,” you might say—discussing the details of the Expanded Universe in one board, and discussing and arguing ethics, religion, and philosophy in another. (Yes, on a Star Wars video game forum. You can’t make people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talk about those things; the best you can do is keep them segregated from the nominal topic of discussion in a forum. And people want to talk about those subjects with friends, people they have other common interests with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway through high school—during prime Star Wars fandom time in the late prequel era—I found my way to &lt;a href="http://boards.theforce.net"&gt;boards.theforce.net (“The Jedi Council Forums”)&lt;/a&gt;, and if the LucasForums had been my introduction to the online world, boards.theforce.net is where I “grew up” online in many ways. Over much of the next decade, I was an active participant in all sorts of things on those forums—from fan fiction-writing and contests, to extended debates on the merits of certain ongoing storylines in the books that made up the Expanded Universe, to the kinds of little controversies that embroil fan communities everywhere over this author’s choices and that author’s body of work and so on. Eventually, late in college, I spent over a year as one of the moderators of the Expanded Universe (strictly speaking, the &lt;em&gt;non-video-games&lt;/em&gt; part) forum there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got married, and I told Jaimie that for our sake I was done with moderating at the end of my senior year in college. Moderating an internet forum &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; is an enormous amount of work. It’s a kind of community-building and it entails all the kinds of difficult work that entails. The fact that it’s online makes it more and not less difficult, in many ways. In the year I was there, we dealt with the gamut: ordinary forum things like overly aggressive arguers and trolls, and less ordinary things like helping a user who seemed to deal with &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"&gt;borderline personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; manage her behavior and be a productive member of the community. I learned an enormous amount there, and much of what I do in online communities &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; remains deeply influenced by the lessons I learned then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not really a surprise, then, that I have a visceral reaction to Star Wars spoilers in a way that I don’t for, say, the next Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. If I get totally spoiled about how &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; plays out before I go see it, well… okay. It’ll be mildly annoying. Something about the ways that I invested in Star Wars and the ways my encounters with it at a broader cultural level were so important to my formation make it matter a lot more to me.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an important question, of course, whether that kind of formation was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for me. Parts of it quite obviously wasn’t. My parents were right to encourage me to take a real and serious break when I was 12. But more than that, they were wise to take the tack of challenging me to think carefully about how to deal with it, rather than simply mandating a particular response themselves. Had they mandated it—which would have been the easier course, I’m sure!—it likely would have backfired and left me resentful of them and unmoved on the actual issue, for one. For another, learning to discipline myself and recognize and head off unhealthy obsessions was itself an important part of my spiritual, intellectual, and emotional formation. Dealing with a relatively benign obsession, and learning to deal with it in a helpful and thoughtful way, was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, my participation in those forums had its risks, even if they were much lower than some of the moral panics of the time suggested. (Predators, it turned out, may have been lurking in chat rooms &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, but many corners of the internet were pretty safe.) The bigger risks to me were risks of time-wasting and getting sucked into pointless or meaningless arguments. But because the forums I ended up in were well-run, they ended up instead being a training ground for how to conduct discourse online in a civil way—to disagree, even deeply (and even, sometimes, about silly things) without resorting to insults and attacks, to argue the merits instead of the quality of the person making an argument. It also afforded me opportunities to make mistakes talking about things that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; matter, rather than primarily about things that did. If I annoyed someone with my view of Jacen Solo in The New Jedi Order, well… okay, better that than mishandling the gospel or misrepresenting Scripture’s teaching on something. Along those same lines, I had opportunities to lead online in a safe environment where most of what I was dealing wasn’t that serious, and I had lots of help including from many people much older than me to deal with the more serious things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, because I knew deeply and well the shape of what was, in many ways, internet discourse at its best, I also was well-primed to recognize two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is when things &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; look like that. I spent a year or so in college on conservative political news sites and comment threads, and while the mid-2000s were the heyday of &lt;em&gt;blogs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;commenting&lt;/em&gt;—in some really wonderful ways that I miss—even then much of what was floating around in political forums was the kind of toxic rhetoric that has become mainstream since.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I jumped out of those communities because I was able to recognize, precisely because of my experience with The Jedi Council Forums, that this was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a model of good discussion on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the way internet discourse and friendship are simultaneously delightful and very limited. There were people I very much enjoyed getting to know over the years, and a few I considered friends. But the limitations of those relationships were obvious (much, I imagine, as the limitations of friendships conducted solely through letter-writing in ages past was). Text is a delightful medium, and it affords certain things that face-to-face interaction doesn’t, especially time for precision and accuracy in communication. But it takes away as well as gives: your wording &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be so precise, because otherwise it far more easily risks misunderstanding. Language must often be more conciliatory in text than it would in person to achieve the same effect, for the simple reason that there is no such thing as tone. And ten thousand emojis are not worth one real, sympathetic smile across a room for expressing, “I disagree with you, but I mean no harm in my disagreement.” The internet affords many opportunities to connect with people we would otherwise never meet, but it does not and cannot &lt;em&gt;substitute&lt;/em&gt; for the kinds of friendships we have in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latter insight was in many ways the first, foundational layer for much of my thinking on the goods and ills offered by the internet since—thinking that has come out especially in &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and increasingly also is finding a home in &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/why-do-i-need-a-research-tool.html"&gt;the reading and research projects&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned here earlier in the week. It also continues to inform the way I think about many other relationships I have &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; online. Though I am part of a number of several really delightful online communities, I never allow those relationships to become my substitutes for doing the work of building friendships with people face to face. And I also take the opportunity, whenever I can, to add face-to-face components to those relationships! One of my closest friends now is someone I met via a group of Christian developers I’m part of online—but he’s also someone I’ve spent many hours with in person now, and it was those hours in person that dramatically changed the character of our friendship. Similarly, another of my best friends is someone I get to talk to mostly only via chat now—but we had years of face-to-face relationship as foundation to stand on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the net of it all is good, I think. I’m grateful for the ways Star Wars has been a part, and an important part, of my life. (So don’t spoiler &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; for me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had grown up having a parallel experience with Marvel comics instead of Star Wars, the experience might well be flipped—though since the MCU is largely adaptations of, if often &lt;em&gt;very free&lt;/em&gt; adaptations of, existing comics work, it would likely play out in rather different ways.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience was with “conservative” sites, but you could see many of the same phenomena on the left then as well.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I’ve been able to make progress on a writing project&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has stymied me for months and months. Yesterday and today alike I wrote 600–700 words in roughly an hour (and words I’m relatively happy with, at that). All my previous efforts at this had come to about 600 words in total, largely in outline form, and when I’d taken a stab at it other than that I’d eventually given up and thrown away anything I’d written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pleasant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;Knowing your rhythms&lt;/a&gt; is useful, it turns out; even more useful is taking advantage of them to actually get things done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I’m noticing (as I write at about 6:45pm, in one of those “just okay” spans I mentioned in that post) is that my mind is ticking along again in what I’ve historically called “writing mode.” The idea of sitting down and knocking out a few hundred words of (admittedly self-indulgent) blogging has not seemed relaxing or fun in quite some time. But that’s changing a bit as I stretch those muscles again. I’ve drawn the analogy often enough in the past, but I’ll repeat it once more: writing is very much like exercising. The act of simply &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; it day over day helps reopen pathways in the mind (like running down paths in the woods, perhaps?) and every day you do it makes the next day easier than it otherwise would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now: off to work on a New Rustacean episode script, because the juices are flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

Between 6am and 10am, and from roughly 8pm to midnight, I am at my most alert and most mentally capable. By contrast, 10am to 1pm is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, and 1pm to 4pm is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; and 4pm to 8pm is back to &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. I can get things done in that span, but it’s very difficult especially to do things like writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also can’t get by on only 6 hours of sleep, so a lot of my best time isn’t available to me one way or the other. In general that means that if I want to write or otherwise do really creative work, I have limited options. Since, as &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/why-do-i-need-a-research-tool.html" title="Why Do I Need a Research Tool?"&gt;I noted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I’m aiming to be doing a fair bit of research and writing over the next few years, I need at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that time. That goes for the thinking-and-writing-intensive work of preparing for New Rustacean episodes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my job allows me considerable flexibility, I can’t just take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the time for side projects, whether those research projects, or working on New Rustacean. Too: my evening concentration ability is much lower than my morning concentration ability, because I’m also the dad of two small children, and between finishing working in the late afternoon and getting them to bed around 7:30–8:00pm, I am much drained mentally. (Kids are awesome, but they can be exhausting!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to try something: every day starting this week and running through the end of the month (whether I’m working or not), the time before 7am is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. After making breakfast for me and my wife, and reading my Bible for some time, I’m going to use that time to work on reading and research, blogging and longer-form writing, New Rustacean prep, and the like. If, by the end of this month, I evaluate that it’s going well (I rather suspect it will be), I’ll formalize that as something to keep doing in the next year. (Accordingly, I’ll report back on how it has gone so far in my usual end-of-year writeup!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, at least, it already feels like something of a win to have gotten some words out here at the start of the day, and I feel far more &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to write now than I normally do after a full work day during that mid-to-late afternoon mental slump!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me that there’s a really important thing implicit in the whole question that’s perhaps worth making explicit. That is: &lt;em&gt;it’s worth doing the work of capturing what you’re reading&lt;/em&gt;, at least when it’s relevant to something you’re &lt;em&gt;studying&lt;/em&gt;. This isn’t necessarily obvious, and especially if you have a good memory, you can often get by in shorter-form writing and day-to-day conversation by relying on your memory. It’ll get you &lt;em&gt;close enough&lt;/em&gt; that you can say, “Oh, so-and-so says this,” or even fall back to “I wish I could remember where I read this…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you want to do something a bit more substantive—say, a medium-length essay, or a detailed book review, much less a long-form essay or academic paper or (good grief!) a book—well, then you need a way of actually keeping track of what you’ve read and where you read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early reading phases for a research project I’d like to tackle over the next year (and possibly much longer): namely, developing at least for myself a more coherent &lt;em&gt;ethics of technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And one thing I learned in one of my largest projects at Southeastern Seminary (a summary of a variety of theological systems as represented by reading thousands of pages of introductions to them and writing about 80,000 words of summary of those pages) was the importance of taking careful notes on what I read and then being able to reference and make use of those notes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that project also left me deeply, deeply frustrated, because nothing I tried actually satisfied me as a way of taking notes in a way I could reference later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing quotes out by hand is laborious, and it doubles the work you have to do with that reference when you need to incorporate it into a paper or essay later: you’re often enough going to end up typing it out either way. But on the other hand, writing down a quote inscribes something into your mind in a way that tapping on a keyboard doesn’t. (This is part of why I outline every talk, teaching session, and sermon I deliver by hand!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while I’ve developed a system for marking up books in a way that’s reasonably unobtrusive but is easy to understand,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; that markup in the text of a book has its own issues. I’ve resorted to dog-earing pages with the most important quotes and ideas in the past, but found this dissatisfying. I know some people use colored page markers, and I need to try that as an approach (though it offends my aesthetic sensibilities as much or more than dog-earing in its own way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the inciting incident for this blog post: I was thinking as I read &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/it-might-be-impossible-for-future-historians-to-understand-our-internet/547463/" title="&amp;quot;Future Historians Probably Won&amp;#39;t Understand Our Internet, and That&amp;#39;s Okay&amp;quot;"&gt;a helpful article by Alexis Madrigal at the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and then saved it to pinboard that it’s a lot of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to do this kind of thing. But if you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do it, you’re floundering around and hoping that your memory or &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; or the combination of the two will get you back to where you need to be for some or another bit of research you’re doing… and good luck with that. In my experience, the more I’ve read on a topic, the harder it can be to remember &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; where I read a particularly important idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I’m curious about people’s research tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this as my following some of the same kinds of paths being worn down right now by writers and thinkers like &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org"&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/the-frailest-thing/"&gt;L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s certainly not &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; as a line of thinking for me—see a related post &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/theological-anthropology.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use brackets to mark off important quotes, the same way someone might use a highlighter, because I hate highlighted books myself. I’ll underline &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; important bits. I jot comments notes in the margins. I mark places where I disagree sufficiently strongly with an “x” and where I agree sufficiently strongly with a check mark or an exclamation point. Things that are essential items in the argument of the book—i.e. things which articulate or are central to argument for the thesis of the book—I’ll mark in the margins with a star. Nothing complicated!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

So: how in the world do you manage your research notes?</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started thinking again today about how I want to tackle reading and writing and organizing my notes and the like. Scribbling things in journals is one good approach (though it can be hard to find things later), and organization is something of a problem—I’ve considered a notebook-per-subject approach, but the problem is that my interests are cross-disciplinary; and in any case, for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, research often includes the unexpected insight from an apparently unrelated field. So segregating things off that way seems like the kind of thing that would ultimately still just end up frustrating me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tools like &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:chriskrycho/" title="my Pinboard"&gt;pinboard&lt;/a&gt; is another approach. It’s a particularly valuable one for digital articles and the like, and it has the tag-like architecture I’ve come to think is most appropriate for organizing this kind of content. However, I haven’t yet upgraded to the full article archive mode it offers, and search-ability remains something of a bugbear for me as a result. (My lasting problem remains remembering &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I read something specific.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And bringing all the pieces together—notes scribbled in the margins of books and highlights or underlines in the same; thoughts jotted out at length in a paper journal; pinboard links; half-finished blog posts which helped me formulate ideas even if they never went anywhere—is its own task I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; handle on. Four and a half years of graduate education &lt;em&gt;exacerbated&lt;/em&gt; the problem rather than suggesting solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m curious to hear, especially from working scholars and writers out there—into whose company I’d like to slowly grow myself in the years ahead—how in the world do you manage your research notes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve spent the last several years listening to podcasts in much of my walking and running time, I’ve started blocking out times in which I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; listening to things that way—times dedicated either to just instrumental music, or simply to silence. This goes for more than those walks and runs. I’ve also been thinking about driving time, which I likewise once filled with thought, but which in recent years I have, again, filled with podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my runs in silence. I often drove in silence or with only instrumental music. I moved away from that somewhat in my years in North Carolina, in part because I discovered a great many podcasts I enjoyed, and in part because it was a way of sustaining mental focus when I had run the same routes too many times. Soon, it bled into my pomodoro walks and into nearly all my drives as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But much of my best thinking happened in those silences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need that space for letting my mind tease out questions and issues I’m thinking on. So: while not eliminating podcasts, I have been intentionally carving out more and more time again for silence. Pomodoro walks, runs, drives. Times when I simply listen to interesting music and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for silence goes beyond merely podcasts for me. I’ve continued to think about the role of Twitter in my life, the amount of time I spend looking at RSS feeds, and even my enjoyment of times in e.g. Slack communities I participate in. Twitter I have long limited strictly—it’s &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org/joe-posnanski-wises-up/"&gt;an enormous and often unproductive time sink&lt;/a&gt;—but even RSS (which is much better for thought in nearly every way!) and healthy Slack communities can be &lt;em&gt;connecting&lt;/em&gt; in ways that actually &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:ayjay/b:c7d2be58b366"&gt;inhibit deep thought&lt;/a&gt;. We need a degree of solitude and silence to think well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, though each of those is often a good source of information, and I enjoy them, I am increasingly aware of the curious ways they interact with my ability to think clearly and deeply about things. And about the ways they shift the &lt;em&gt;arena&lt;/em&gt; of my thinking clearly and deeply about things. Pose me a question and I’m apt to answer it, but the way I answer it in a Slack chat is different from—and often worse than—the way I’d answer it if I took the time to write it up as a blog post, and that in turn different from how I would approach it if composing a medium-length essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am sussing out where and how I want to draw those lines, where I want to &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2017/11/18/the-ethics-of-technological-mediation/"&gt;pay my attention&lt;/a&gt;, because &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-for-disputation/"&gt;attention is indeed something we pay&lt;/a&gt;. Fewer podcasts, less time in ephemeral media (even including blogging); more time in books and long essays and in writing itself as a means of coming to understanding. More time, indeed, scribbling notes in paper notebooks, for the ways that time spent thinking &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; disconnected from the internet shapes us. More time, when I’m writing in a digital form, with the wifi off. And hopefully, as a result, more and better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I keep my book review ratings simple—they’re either &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;recommended&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;recommended with qualifications&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;not recommended&lt;/em&gt;. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; Kahneman is a talented writer, has a fascinating research history, and makes a good case; there’s a lot to learn here, and the quibbles I have are just that: quibbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good things about Daniel Kahneman’s &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;, so when friends asked what they might get me for my birthday, it came to mind quickly. I didn’t spend long second-guessing the choice, and it’s not one I’ve regretted in the least (even though I have my differences with the book). That experience—an immediate choice, based on some degree of prior knowledge (but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much); followed by basic continuation along the same judgment without giving it much further thought—is itself representative of many of the themes of the book. How do we choose? What makes us decide the things we do, and why? How can we make better decisions? Why do we so often make irrational choices, and so quickly, over and against what we might choose if we slowed down to think through our decisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt; takes up all of those questions and runs with them. Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics but himself a psychologist by training and decades of practice, produced here a popularization of decades of research on how people think. His basic thesis is that we have two systems of thought: One is quick to the point of immediacy and even functioning unconsciously, intuitionist or heuristic in nature, and extremely effective and reliable for &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; situations—but because it is intuitionist or heuristic, also biased in certain predictable ways. The other is much slower, but capable of careful and rational consideration, not prone to the same kinds of mistakes as the first but also substantially more work to engage and itself readily enough misled by the judgments we make with that first system of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter or so of the book, Kahneman makes his case that these two systems actually do characterize human thought, at least in broad strokes. And it’s a good case that he makes. Many of the examples he cites I was readily enough able to see playing out in my own mind, whether in real-time or by reflecting on past decision-making and judgment-making instances. This is also the part of the book on the strongest research ground, from what I can tell as an outsider. On the whole, I came away convinced of that basic theme. Whatever other places I differ with him, and there are a few, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; recommend the book for its first quarter at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter parts of the book shift into examinations of specific ways that those two systems-of-thinking actually play out in practice, and here the material, though still strong overall, was a great deal more arguable. Much of this draws heavily on studies in psychology—and some of those studies have since run into some really serious problems with reproducibility. So much so that Kahneman—himself a popularizer rather than a producer of those specific experiments—wrote an open letter to the community of researchers asking them to do the hard work of either reproducing their results or walking back their claims.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As such, even if I agreed with Kahneman philosophically throughout (and I don’t; more on that in a moment), there would be some gaps in the final section of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond some of these kinds of overall weaknesses, there’s also a downside to the rhetorical approach Kahneman takes. Throughout, he adopts an extremely conversational style, addressing the reader quite directly. As such, many of his claims take the form “You did &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; when you encountered &lt;em&gt;some test&lt;/em&gt; in the text.” Many of these work and prove accurate… but quite a few of them don’t, too. The specifics will differ for everyone, of course, based on how well-trained they are at certain kinds of reasoning, their backgrounds, their ethical systems, and the like. But it happens, and it happened to me fairly often during the course of reading the book. One of the most striking examples was near the end, where Kahneman was trying to show that we often will assign different values to given things when evaluated independently than when evaluated side-by-side. He made there a claim about what the reader did or didn’t do in evaluating the needs of humans vs. evaluating the need for dolphins—specifically, that the specific valuation of humans over dolphins didn’t emerge until the two were compared more directly. But it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; for me; it was the first thought I had. I’ll grant his broader point, of course, and I don’t doubt that in many cases the studies he cites represent real tendencies. I can certainly think of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; scenarios where a similar kind of comparison might break down. But it’s an interesting place where the conversational style breaks down: you can only assert so much and get away with it. On the other hand, a book full of questions of the “Did you think &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;?” sort would get old quickly. This is a hard line to walk, and on the whole I think the style worked—but it had that nagging weakness, which stuck out to me fairly frequently when reading the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found, unsurprisingly, that Kahneman and I differ fairly strongly in our view of both ethics and human nature. On the whole, this didn’t directly impact my appreciation of the book. On occasion, however, his view of human nature diverged quite sharply from the Christian view. In particular, he left little room for the idea of our nature being &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to have certain kinds of limitations about it and majored heavily on rationalism as &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t think strict rationalism &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in fact ideal, and whereas he contents himself with describing &lt;a href="http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/econs-and-humans/"&gt;Econs&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; view of how humans work (but one that he often refers to in rather aspirational ways), I would go much further: it would in fact be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; for humans to act as the purely “rational” agents of much standard economic theory, because that kind of rationalism is in fact merely a particular brand of utilitarianism. I’d go further still and say that utilitarianism is itself a kind of irrationality, and that one of the ways human nature continues to function as a divine image is in our deep-seated and nearly inescapable distinguishing between kinds of things that economists tell us are of &lt;em&gt;equal utility&lt;/em&gt;: for so they may be, but there is more to God’s green earth than the uses to which we may put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But important though those differences are, they are also far afield of the thesis and even the majority emphasis of the book. Indeed, precisely because it does acknowledge so clearly the way humans actually work, the book can serve as a helpful entry-point for conversation about the limits of utilitarianism. If utility is not a perfect description of how humans do work, perhaps it also behooves us to consider if it’s a good description of how we &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, the book as a whole is a genuinely good and insightful volume. Many of the kinds of biases and errors Kahneman point out are unarguably problems—and many of them contribute significantly to systematic issues in the world at large. Being more aware of how our ability to think clearly and rightly degrades when we are, say, tired and hungry, should make us think carefully about assigning a judge a long docket of cases to sentence: why should two men who committed the same crime get different punishments simply because one received his sentence in the morning when the judge was alert and fresh off her breakfast and coffee, and the other late in the morning when she was feeling hungry and drained? There are not easy solutions to these kinds of problems, but we cannot even begin to address them unless we know they exist in the first place. Similarly, at a personal level, knowing these things about ourselves can help us be aware of where we’re vulnerable to them and adjust accordingly—whether by aiming to increase our awareness of them situation-by-situation, or (better) by making careful choices when able to do so which we can then lean on in the situations where we have to make snap judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more to say about that latter point, not least on the topic of Christian formation, discipleship, and catechesis. But that’s for another post. Read at least the first section of &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;: you’ll profit from it, and you’ll enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll update it with books as I finish them, and I’ll also update it with reviews (even of the “here’s a brief comment” variety) as I do them. This is something I’ve been thinking about doing for my own sake for a while, and bumping into &lt;a href="http://tbrown.org/notes/2017/06/23/reading-and-sharing/"&gt;this post by Tim Brown&lt;/a&gt; reminded me how much I want to be sharing what I read with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get myself spun up on thinking that I need to be reviewing books with the best of them. In reality, I really just want to do like Tim says in that post (emphasis his):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am reading and sharing ideas about what I have read, I feel like my best self. &lt;em&gt;I want more of that feeling.&lt;/em&gt;… I’m wondering if acknowledging what I read, along with a substantial visual (a book cover image?) and any highlights or notes, could feel just as good as having a physical book…. Maybe I could list my piles of books here on my website, and link them to blog post entries with highlights/notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it exactly. So I’m going ahead and doing the work: I’m going to keep that list up to date, and I’m going to try to write and share &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about every book I read for the rest of the year. It doesn’t have to be a lot—just a sentence or two will do in many cases. “I liked it” or “This had a lot of potential but didn’t quite measure up to it.” Something simple like &lt;a href="https://wynnnetherland.com/reviews/to-hell-and-back-europe-1914-1949/"&gt;what Wynn Netherland does&lt;/a&gt;, or something long and careful when it makes good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday I’ll be able to write one of those killer reviews that ends up changing a whole conversation, or maybe I’ll just have a bunch of interesting notes I can look back on later and be able to see what I thought about a book when I’m curious a decade later. Either way, I think it’ll be a nice win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017-book-list.html"&gt;book list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve been a fairly steady practitioner of the habit of marking what I do in any given 25-minute work cycle. However, I’ve felt of late that while I usually had a good sense of what my goals had been and whether I had accomplished them for any given small &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the day, I didn’t have a clear sense of what I had done over the day as a whole—much less at the end of a whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just started summarizing it at the end of each day, or early the next day, and pulling those summaries into a single document at the end of the week. (If you’re curious, I’ve been doing all of this in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, which of course I use in its Markdown mode.) So on any given Friday, I can actually look at my week as a whole and have some concrete sense of what I’ve accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve only done this for the past three weeks, but I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like it and I intend to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I need to figure out how to integrate into it is non-work tasks. And really, that goes for my life in general right now. I’m &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/on-decompression.html" title="On Decompression"&gt;still sorting through&lt;/a&gt; what it looks like to just be working a full-time job and having a few side projects. But I’d like to be able to look back at the end of each month and boil down those weekly summaries, and at the end of the year likewise with the months—and from the combination, actually know a bit more concretely what my year was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how it goes. I’m sure I’ll be back with more to say in this space soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

And rest. And I'm taking a break from formal plans for the rest of this year, because I and our family need it.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about reading plans and book lists. And about rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans and lists may not sound like rest to you; that’s fine: they don’t to me, either. I’ve been eager to move back into the kinds of reading I’m actively interested in doing now that I’m done with my seminary degree. But one of the challenges is that I need—and I’m &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aware of this need—to decompress a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last roughly 8 years have been &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; fairly constantly. I began my first job after college the day after Jaimie and I got back from our honeymoon. For the next two years I worked full-time there &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; taught myself web development and then did 8–10 hours a week of web development consulting on the side while she finished school. I kept up that pace for another year and a half after that other than a slight break just after Ellie was born, and then we moved to North Carolina for me to get an M. Div. from &lt;a href="http://www.sebts.edu"&gt;SEBTS&lt;/a&gt;. Since we moved here, I’ve always been working—anywhere from 20 to 60 hours a week, always in at least one class a semester and often as many as three. All along the way, I’ve also been reading and writing for myself: these things are relaxing for me. And for the sheer joy and need of a good outlet, I added podcasting along the way as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the takeaway of all of that is that I’ve had to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; structured and disciplined with my time. I have always had a detailed schedule and an idea of what I wanted or needed to be working on at any given time: from learning new things in software to writing blog posts, and from actually programming as a job to writing papers for seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to breathe a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very keenly the need to &lt;em&gt;decompress&lt;/em&gt;. Not to stop doing things, but to add some slack to the schedule, to keep my number of hard external commitments low and to keep any self-imposed pressures low as well. That will let me recharge and avoid burnout, and it will give me lots of good time to just hang out with Jaimie and our little girls. We’ve made space for the family all the way through, but it has always been a matter of scheduling it and fitting it in. I’m looking forward to a season where it’s just normal for us to play and read and do life together. As I said: a kind of decompression, letting things stretch back out a bit and decreasing the tension of always being on a tight schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that until about January 2018, I am not making myself a &lt;em&gt;reading list&lt;/em&gt; in the way I want to in the future. Why do I even want that? Because I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it. So the better question is: why do I think I need a reading list or a plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a voracious, multi-disciplinary reader, but this has two problems. One is I can be a bit like a squirrel: always seeing something shiny in that new subject &lt;em&gt;over there&lt;/em&gt;. The other is that I can get sucked incredibly deep into one genre so that I end up reading only theology or programming or the like for six months. Having a plan and a reading list will help me both dig deeply and in focused ways into the subjects on which I want to think (and write!) more, but it will also help me balance that with a good mix of other kinds of reading from other fields—something which is both broadly helpful and which inevitably &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/art/and-the-stew-tastes-good/"&gt;produces a better mix of insights&lt;/a&gt; than just reading one subject in isolation does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for all the reasons outlined above: not now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have books I want to read over the rest of this year. The list right now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fyodor Dostoevsky, &lt;em&gt;The Idiot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Kahneman, &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oliver O’Donovan, &lt;em&gt;Resurrection and Moral Order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandon Sanderson, the various sequels to &lt;em&gt;Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians&lt;/em&gt; (which I read and quite enjoyed last month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Taylor, &lt;em&gt;A Secular Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, &lt;em&gt;Beren and Lúthien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a “list,” but it’s a list composed of exactly one kind of book: whatever I feel like reading. There are other books I’ve already started that aren’t on that list because while they’re important to me, they’re not decompressive at all: they feel like work, like pressure. And what I and my family need right now—especially in the midst of planning a cross-country move to be nearer our families in a new home!—is to relieve pressure, not add more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I’m going to go read one of those books on our porch. Whichever one I feel like. And then I’ll read whichever one I feel like &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt;. And if the list changes, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of context, we use &lt;a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com" title="You Need A Budget"&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;YNAB&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we have two ways we spend money on coffee: going out to coffee shops, and as groceries. Perhaps surprisingly, it has been the latter of those two which has been giving us trouble: that second cup of coffee every day—you know, for the pick-me-up in the early afternoon—adds up in a hurry, especially when you’re buying &lt;a href="https://counterculturecoffee.com/"&gt;Counter Culture&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/"&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided this week to make one small tweak to our budgeting flow which should help stem this tide of coffee a bit. Namely: we now have an allocated amount of coffee per day, and if we go past that, a corresponding amount of money moves from our coffee shop budget into our grocery budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how that works in practice. Our last bag of Counter Culture cost $17.61. I allot myself 8 ounces per day. On Tuesday, I drank an extra 6-ounce cup in the afternoon. The bag is 12 ounces of coffee beans, which is 340 grams. A 6-ounce cup, made the way I make it, uses 11 grams of beans. So then I did a little math: &lt;code&gt;(11 / 340) * 17.61 ~= 0.57&lt;/code&gt; – so I moved $0.57 from my coffee shop budget to my grocery budget. I did the same with the extra 4-ounce cup I had yesterday and the extra 2 ounces I had in my cup this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this budgeting done in excruciatingly minute detail? Yes. Is it helpful to me? Also yes. Do I recommend it? Not unless you’re in the same ballpark of obsessiveness as I am!&lt;/p&gt;

Finishing my M. Div. is giving me more time, and that’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wonderful. The trick now is deciding which of the many things I want to do will get my attention. I can split my focus a thousand ways, or I can pick a few tasks and zero in on them and aim to be good at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of blogging, I have no doubt it’s something I want to continue. But I need to think about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I want to use it, and this relates closely to some of my goals for an information architecture-level restructuring of the site I want to do when I finish building &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;lightning-rs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Blogging&lt;/em&gt;, at its best, isn’t long-form articles (though there is certainly room for those on my website as a whole), but &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/samuel/2017/02/17/4-requests-young-evangelical-writers/" title="4 Requests to Young Evangelical Writers"&gt;short, cogent pieces which pack a punch and move on&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/01/those-darn-millennials.html" title="those darn millennials?"&gt;thinking out loud&lt;/a&gt;. Even in my own experience, the best &lt;em&gt;blog posts&lt;/em&gt; I have written are quite different from the best &lt;em&gt;essays&lt;/em&gt; I have written. Embracing that seems like a helpful first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more than a few large project-style blog posts I have not finished—most regrettably, at present, one about podcasting which I told a friend I was working on some weeks ago—in part because I have tried to treat them like blog posts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; essays or projects at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think I’d like to end up with is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; like this, in terms of structure in the new site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;—something like a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book"&gt;“commonplace journal”&lt;/a&gt;, but shared publicly. This would include several kinds of content:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blog posts—things like this little piece, of course, but also the &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; majority of the content I put on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;links to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt; Series&lt;/strong&gt;—the home for more substantive chunks of content
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-running series like my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; posts, which are not particularly &lt;em&gt;bloggy&lt;/em&gt; (for lack of a better word)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things like my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;2016 in Review&lt;/a&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some projects more like some of the things &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com"&gt;Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt; has done over the years: curated collections of materials that complement each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articles&lt;/strong&gt;—call this aspirational; if or when I have things published in a more formal way, I’d like them to have a home on my website as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure has some challenges of its own, of course. Where does a poem go? Is it part of my “journal” or is it more of a one-off “project”? And within those, I shall want both overlapping “categories” as well as cross-cutting “subjects”: it is impossible to cleanly separate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my Tech and Theology writing from each other, yet having &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; high-level categories grows increasingly important for navigating the site as its content grows. (This becomes a problem even just for me as I look for old posts to link them—much less for any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reader of my site!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem with all such taxonomies is that they are arbitrary and constrictive so far as they cannot overlap. Perhaps something goes in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;—but then that makes it far harder for a user of the site to navigate. And here, as I hinted in my parenthetical above, there is another of these tensions: how I think of something and use it for organization of my materials is broadly orthogonal to the needs or interests of potential readers, and both of us use the site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are problems for all sufficiently complex collections of data. It is equally as hard to manage these questions of organization for large, focused writing projects (like a thesis or a novel) as for a varied collection of materials like this site, though the details differ. It is much &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; when dealing with an operating system and its collection of myriad kinds of data. We muddle on with our self-imposed limitations, because the alternative tends to be chaos. Unconstrained tagging systems quickly devolve to madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not merely a digital problem: filing cabinets have the same constraints. Yet perhaps the apparent &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; offered by the digital world exacerbates it; the sense that perhaps we could escape the constraint that a note can only go in one place—because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; go in more than one virtual place—makes us reach for solutions which may only increase our frustration in the end. Perhaps just being forced to put something in a place (even if not a perfect one) is a good discipline. But perhaps not; perhaps that freedom is a gift if we use it wisely. I think there is room for further work here in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: more to come as I continue to chew on these problems of information architecture and user interface. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho"&gt;Links to others’ thoughts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=Structuring%20content"&gt;more detailed comments of your own&lt;/a&gt; most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

As such, I’ve broken it into a series of posts, to be published daily through the start of the new year. Hopefully they’re a bit more digestible that way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;Part 2: So. many. words. I had no idea how many words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-3.html"&gt;Part 3: Podcasting: Winning Slowly, New Rustacean, and more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-4.html"&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017! (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I really only have a few big goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of smaller goals, too, of course. That list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically all of those are flexible (and, if I’m honest, so is #6 in the first list—though it’s a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; priority as far as the flexible ones go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good handle on how I’m going to chase those things. The productivity patterns I’ve established over the last couple years are serving me well so far, and I expect them to continue to. After graduation, things will obviously look a little different, and I’m looking forward to that, too. Being able to take vacations where I’m not losing ground by not working on school projects? That sounds truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking forward to digging into more books I want to read and making progress on writing I want to do in the realm of theology, philosophy, ethics, and so on. I’ve spent nearly all the mental energy I have available for those subjects on seminary work over the past several years (with varying degrees of value for that effort). Once again being able to focus my own external studies as I like will be very freeing, I think. I hope to find some ways to continue to work at something like an academic level, and—crazy though it sounds right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;—I do hope to get a Ph.D. in &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in a few decades. But I am looking forward to having a lot of years of reading and writing outside academia between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those goals are good, but ultimate I’m willing to just see what the year brings. I’d love to compose music again more regularly and at greater length. I’d love to write more fiction, and more (and better) poetry. But we’ll also be starting some schooling with Ellie, and dealing with the logistics of planning a move to Colorado sometime in late 2017 or the first half of 2018. We’ll be enjoying just not having nearly so much to do right after finishing seminary. It’s worth remembeirng to rest, and not do just jump into another season of being incredibly slammed by busyness. I plan to take some time to read novels and play video games, too. Those things are good for our souls in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And come what may, I hope to glorify God in the midst of it. Rest, work, play, side projects, you name it—&lt;em&gt;soli deo gloria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond. (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a number of points over the last few years, I’ve tackled the question of productivity. I always have far more I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done than I’m able to actually get to. A few of those posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;Boosting My Productivity&lt;/a&gt; (December, 2014)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;A New Schedule: Trying to make better use of my time toward my goals&lt;/a&gt; (July 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of all productivity plans, of course, is that one can get more focused on the details of the plan than on actually being productive! I’m happy to say, however, that this &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; the case for me with these productivity approaches. First, I have never allowed myself to be slavish about them. If I need to do something different on a given day, I do something different. Second, I am generally able to remember that the point of the plan is &lt;em&gt;what I’m getting done&lt;/em&gt;. So with that in mind, some comments particularly on the plan I sketched out &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;mid-year this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell off that wagon almost immediately. Readers who’ve stuck with me through these various updates will note that this ambitious plan preceded my disastrous 20-mile run and the ensuing bout of walking pneumonia by a matter of days. It took me until September to get back on the horse, so to speak, because even after I got over being sick, I was traveling—and nothing throws off my schedule like traveling! Happily, I got quite a bit done both during the conference trip I took and during the week I was in Colorado for my youngest sister’s wedding, but it wasn’t until after both of those that I was able to settle back into the routine I’d aimed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major themes of that post were a detailed plan for my days, cutting out a lot of my social media, and thinking about weekends. The detailed plan for my days I kept off and on. I never consistently managed to have the block of time-for-side-projects at the end of my days, and that increasingly meant those things cut into weekends (impacting that goal as well). As for social media, that’s largely been a success: I now rarely get on Facebook, and only check Twitter from time to time. Certainly neither is much of a timesink anymore. I do continue to make heavy use of Slack outside of work, but I’ve found a good balance there (and the main communities I’m a part of have gone through their own adjustments as we’ve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; found the need for this kind of focus and balance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it wasn’t perfect, but I did find it a very useful approach overall. I fully expect to stick with something very like it in 2017. Hopefully I won’t be pulling as many 10–11 hour days as I was in the latter half of 2016—but regardless, building this new discipline around the overall structure of each day was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; part of my approach to productivity that I’m definitely going to keep is the “pomodoro” technique. I first mentioned this in the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; discussion I posted about this, but I’ve embraced it more and more. I work in 25-minute blocks, punctuated by 5-minute breaks. Nearly all of those 5-minute breaks entail walking, and as a result I get about 2–3 miles of walking in every day on top of my runs. That helps enormously with focus. This fall, I also embraced the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; half of the pomodoro technique: writing down goals and outcomes for each of those 25-minute blocks. Even more than the daily goals I discussed in the opening post of this series, this lower level of tracking has proved very helpful. It has given me a sense of what I have actually accomplished each day, and it has also helped me &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; as I’m trying to keep moving on various tasks each day. I highly recommend using the pomodoro approach (adapted as necessary to your particular circumstances, of course) as a tool for that kind of focus and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be remiss if I didn’t also note the following &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; substantial factors in my productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fitness/health:&lt;/strong&gt; if I’m active, I focus better. People say they don’t have time to exercise; I mean it when I say I don’t have time &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. I keep it pretty simple: running, cycling, swimming, and body-weight strength stuff. But I do it basically every day. And we eat fairly healthily. Both of those are incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; no matter how busy I am, I don’t pull all-nighters or anything of the sort. I get a minimum of 6 and usually 7–7½ hours of sleep every night. Even when I’m tired from pulling week after week of 10-hour work days, I can keep going because I get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no commute:&lt;/strong&gt; working remotely is awesome for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that I don’t lose the hour or three every day to the road/subway/etc. that many people I know do. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time over the course of a year. 48 working weeks means if you commute for an hour total every day, that’s 240 hours a year—that’s 30 8-hour days worth of “getting things done”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point after I finish seminary I will expand the various things I do in productivity into a more complete series, but this gives you a good idea of what 2016 looked like, and what I expect 2017 to look like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;Part 2: So. many. words. I had no idea how many words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-3.html"&gt;Part 3: Podcasting: Winning Slowly, New Rustacean, and more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source. (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at Olo was a great year overall. I very much enjoy working with the people there, the tech stack is good and they’re paying me to do what I love, and if the product isn’t lighting my world on fire (online restaurant ordering is cool, but restaurants aren’t a passion of mine), that’s a tradeoff I can live with. Working with good people with a good tech stack on a product you find &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; is actually pretty great. I’m grateful for previous jobs, but this one has superceded them in every possible way. I’m &lt;em&gt;glad&lt;/em&gt; to start work every day—and in truth, there have been more than a few days where I would have liked nothing more than to keep writing JavaScript rather than switching over to do some reading and writing for seminary. That bodes well for my future plans: post-seminary, I expect to bump from 30 to 40 hours a week with Olo&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and keep making our software as awesome as I can. And I expect to enjoy that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of numbers: GitHub reports that I contributed +29,463/−13,726 lines of code in our new mobile web ordering experience, which I helped build nearly from scratch this year. (That “negative” is stuff I rewrote or removed entirely by finding a better implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a bit of my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; this year was technical, too: some ~33,000 of the words on my blog—fully a third of the things I published on this site apart from microblog posts and schoolwork—was about software. That included entries 11–18 of my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, but about 20,000 words were assorted discussions of JavaScript, Rust, podcasting, functional programming, etc. A fair bit of that content came out of things I worked on for Olo, either directly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html" title="What is Functional Programming? (And why should we care about it?)"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;) or indirectly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/keyof-and-mapped-types-in-typescript-21.html" title="keyof and Mapped Types in TypeScript 2.1"&gt;this discussion of TypeScript 2.1&lt;/a&gt;) That’s a good mix, and I hope to continue putting out material that’s useful to others as well as interesting to me. (I do get tweets now and again confirming that the content is helpful, and I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; run analytics on the site at all—so if you like something I write, please tell me. It’s encouraging. And that goes for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; author you read, as a rule.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I actually did a little bit of open-source contributing this year. Not as much as I’d like, but a little. And I also count New Rustacean as a pretty substantial contribution to the Rust community. The fact that it isn’t code doesn’t diminish what it’s doing. If you’re feeling like code is the only thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; counts, recognize that all the code in the world isn’t that useful without explanations of how to use it, helping people become interested in the first place, and so on. Speaking of non-code contributions, the open-source contribution I’m &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; proud of is certainly the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636"&gt;Rust RFC&lt;/a&gt; I wrote and which was recently accepted and merged. It proposed (and it is now the official policy of the Rust project) that no new features may be added to the (stable version of the) language or the standard library without first being documented. This is a big deal for the language, and it was also a big deal for me, in that it was another place where—despite being far too busy to write a lot of Rust code this year—I could make a real difference in a community I’m passionate about. And one of my goals for next year is a direct follow-on from that: &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;actually implementing the requirement&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big thing going on for me in the software world is that I started work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a new static site generator in Rust. (There’s another such project, &lt;a href="http://cobalt-org.github.io"&gt;Cobalt&lt;/a&gt;, which is already usable.) I’ve been pushing up against the limits of &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, my current generator, for a while. And I’ve looked around time and again, and never found a CMS or SSG that does everything my peculiar publishing needs require (&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a way that I like!). And my needs are indeed peculiar, though probably not wholly unique; for most people, any one of &lt;a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; other site generators&lt;/a&gt; would work just fine. So I’m doing what I’ve been thinking about doing for years, and building my own. My immediate goals are mostly just to have something that is super speedy and which checks off all my needs from a CMS/site generator. My longer-term goals include getting some good foundational knowledge I’ll need for &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a thousand lines in, and have some pieces working. I hope very much to move off of Pelican and onto Lightning (and get a freshened theme for this site) in 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Olo has been incredibly generous and hired me as a full-time employee at 30-hours-a-week with pro-rated salary. Like I said: amazing company.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;the written word&lt;/a&gt;, the other “writing”-type work I had this year—some of it including &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; writing in the form of detailed scripts—was podcasting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Show&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Episodes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Total time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;11h 40m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;6h 46m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;Run With Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1h 1m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;sap.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;12m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;67&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19h 39m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, several of those numbers surprised me a bit. For one thing, I had to put New Rustacean on hiatus starting in October courtesy of the crunch I ended up with from the &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project colliding with the other summer-and-fall commitments I had. For another Stephen and I paused Winning Slowly between Seasons 4 and 5 (as we usually do) and also have taken a mid-season pause on Season 5 because of end-of-semester crunches for both of us and then his wife having a baby a few weeks earlier than expected. Yet in spite of that, almost 20 hours of audio content this year! If I hit that again in 2017, I’ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;sap.py&lt;/a&gt; will be back, I have no idea. I love making the show with Jaimie, but it’s really up to her whether she wants to keep working on Python. Of late, she’s been working on &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PemberlyPrintables" title="Jaimie&amp;#39;s printable shop on Etsy"&gt;printable art&lt;/a&gt; instead, and that’s delightful in its own right. I’ve &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/14/"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; gotten &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;Run With Me&lt;/a&gt; going again in the past day; I got off track when my headphone microphone stopped working for a bit and never got back &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; track when it started working again. I’m looking forward to once again talking about running while running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be publishing an even wider variety of kinds of episodes of New Rustacean in 2017. Listeners should get another couple of interviews, a lot more of the “here is a Rust concept in detail” episodes (at least one a month in general, I hope!), news episodes, undoubtedly a few bonus episodes, and a new “Crates You Should Know” format designed to highlight crates I’ve found useful in my own Rust work. I continue to find Rust a wonderful language, and I hear regularly that this is one of people’s favorite programming podcasts. I hope to keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to wrap up &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html" title="Winning Slowly Season 5: Structure and Agency"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; mid-spring, and then begin recording Season 6 mid-to-late summer. All of that is pending how things go as Stephen finishes his dissertation and likely prepares to move across the country to take a job as a professor somewhere, of course. But that’s the plan—and yes, we already know the rough shape of Season 6, even this far out. We know the season topic, and have some basic ideas of where we want to go with it. As is usually the case with our “seasons” now, it will take ideas we’ve touched on here and there and turn them into a full-blown, months-long exploration of those ideas as applied to specific issues. Winning Slowly remains one of my very favorite projects, not least because there is (to our knowledge) nothing else out there doing quite the same thing. Tackling long-term trends in technology with a distinctively (though not always overtly) Christian perspective (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a reductionist one) is apparently our gap to fill. We’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other podcasting-related bits. First, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/theses-on-podcasting/" title="32 Theses (and several more words) on Podcasting"&gt;~5,000-word piece for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt; explaining how the medium works, what its constraints are, and what is involved in doing it well. If podcasting is interesting to you, I think the piece is well worth your time—precisely because of, and not in spite of, its length! Second, I gave a pair of guest lectures for Stephen at N.C. State University this fall, which are both available in the &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-bonus.html"&gt;bonus section&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;. Those cover some of the same ground as the piece at Mere O, but they also talk a lot more about the details of finding a topic, an “authorial voice”, and an angle for your show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2016 was to continue writing not only on this blog but in other outlets. I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of writing this year, but relatively little of it is published. But here’s a look at some of the numbers! Note that “This site” excludes republication of school papers, and that I don’t have an exact count for the school papers because I’ve already discarded a few of the shorter pieces, but their average length is well-known to me. More on the unpublished &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project below.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Words&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~130,500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;This site&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~63,000&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~9350&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~207,850&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the writing for school, only a small fraction of it is &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;, unlike previous years. Roughly 75,000 words of that content is research notes I put together for an independent study I did—which was deeply profitable for me in terms of thinking through hermeneutical and theological systems, and which will hopefully be helpful for the professor for whom I prepared them, but which are not at all publishable. Another 10,000 of those words fit in a category charitably describable as “busy-work” and publishing them is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; but would have no &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. The school-writing also includes the notes and manuscripts for my sermon-delivery class. You can find those sermons &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons/"&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well well, with audio, video, and the manuscripts available—but the notes are not worth publishing, as they’re entirely internal. Still: they’re words, I wrote them, and there are a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I wrote one of the papers I’m proudest of from my entire seminary career in the spring: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/realism-and-antirealism.html"&gt;Realism and Antirealism—A key debate in the philosophy of science (with interesting implications for young-earth creationism)&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy with it not least because I wrote it in a very compressed fashion because of some family health issues that hit at the end of that semester, and it still turned out extremely well because I had &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; it meticulously. Despite having only a single draft with one typo-level revision pass, it’s easily the best paper I’ve ever written. It turns out that doing a really careful outline helps when you’re working at this scale. I’ve not normally been a fan of outlining (and I’ve not normally found it helpful when I’ve tried it), but for any longer, more sustained argument, it’s absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the content on this site (excluding republication of school papers), an astounding ~14,000 of those words are in my “microblog” content. It’s amazing how much those little posts add up. That said, I’m surprised to see that I’ve put out as many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; words as I have this year on this site, and the total there is rather staggering. Writing on this site includes everything from &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ask.html" title="Ask: a short story"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/to-paint-god-as-a-man.html" title="To paint God as a man: an Advent poem"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-simple-childrens-catechism.html"&gt;a simple children’s catechism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html"&gt;an introduction to functional programming&lt;/a&gt;. I’m exceptionally pleased in retrospect to see how this came out, and I look forward to writing on equally varied terms in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 13,000 of the words I wrote for this site were in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, a project I’ve enjoyed enormously since starting it in 2015 and would like to get back to in 2017. It went on hold because I was offered, and accepted, a contract to write a 30–40 page report for O’Reilly comparing the two languages, which was intended to come out this fall. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way some wires got crossed and my pitch and what they wanted didn’t end up being the same. Once that became clear (at the beginning of October), they opted to drop the project. This was a huge disappointment to me: it was a small hit financially, but a big one time-wise, as I sunk a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hours into it in what was an already-very-busy fall; the project was over ¾ done when it was dropped.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few big lessons I learned from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overcommit. Even if the project had gone through without issue, it would have been more on my plate than I could reasonably handle. The fact that it was canceled after having done a lot of the work meant it was also &lt;em&gt;financially&lt;/em&gt; frustrating, but I had overcommitted regardless. Won’t do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; clear up-front about the terms and goals of a project. I don’t know how we ended up with the crossed wires we did, but it was extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can get an advance, get an advance. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m quite pleased with the &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt; of my output in 2016 (who wouldn’t be, right?). I’d definitely like a lot more of that to be public-facing in 2017, even if it’s lower in overall volume. I hope to take the material from that canceled &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project, expand it slightly, and self-publish it. I also hope to put together at least one substantive essay for Mere Orthodoxy next year. And of course there will probably be thousands of words in this space, too—inevitably more than I even realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note as well that this excludes all the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com/tree/589cd13225cde91f92bfca93f6679f2395d78886/docs"&gt;podcast scripts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this year! Those would add well over 10,000 more words to this count.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that number includes these posts!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted an analysis of when you’d choose each language; I pitched a comparison along similar lines to my blog series, looking at the language design choices as a view into software engineering tradeoffs. When the mismatch became clear, I pointed out that “when to choose Rust vs. Swift” is, generally speaking, a roughly two-sentence answer: “Choose Rust for cross-platform, high-performance/low-level code. Choose Swift if you’re writing apps on an Apple platform.” This was not, apparently, obvious to everyone else involved. In the words of the internet: &lt;span style="whitespace: nowrap"&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, hold on,&lt;/em&gt; you say. &lt;em&gt;Go back. How did you get walking pneumonia?&lt;/em&gt; This is a fun story, and it’s a huge part of what made the other parts of the latter half of 2016 go the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for what I expected to be a 15–16 mile long run as part of training for the half-marathon I signed up for this year. The previous week &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/12/" title="Run summary on runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;I’d done a 14-mile run&lt;/a&gt;, so 15–16 would have been no problem. I was feeling &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; on the run, so decided to extend it to 17. This was right at the edge of what makes good sense for a week-over-week increase in mileage; you generally want to stick with ~10% increases and max out at 20%; but 17 is right at that limit relative to 14. So I turned right to cut through another nearby town instead of left to head directly home when I was at roughly the 11-mile mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, where I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; cut back toward home, I took a wrong turn out of a five-way intersection. (You can see on the north end of the map, in Youngsville, &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/644619792" title="Run overview on Strava"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I realized this half a mile on, but figured there would be a spot to cut over. There is not. So I got back to where I had taken the wrong turn, filled up my water bottle and hit the bathroom, and made my way home. But at this point, I was already at ~15 miles, and ~4 miles from home. As I got back into our town, I decided: why not just go ahead and extend out to 20 miles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is, that extra three quarters of a mile probably didn’t matter a bit. 19.25 vs. 20 miles? Same difference in its effect on my immune system, which is to say: it completely crashed it. A 42% week over week increase in mileage is no joke. The little cold I picked up from my 2-year-old daughter turned into borderline bronchitis. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What with a busy spring preceding—I had no idea how much busier I would be taking 2 classes and working 30 hours a week than I had been taking 3 classes and working 20 hours a week—I didn’t manage a triathlon. I had contented myself with the thought that I’d likely set another PR in my half marathon, but after weeks of recovery from walking pneumonia, that thought fell apart as well. I lost about a minute per mile in my pace, and my mileage was shot as well. I never got it back—not least because of a writing project which went south on me. I ended up being sick off and on all fall, and I’m only now getting my feet back under me. Sad to say, one of those times I got sick was the week of the half marathon I signed up for, and I’d been getting loud, clear signals from my body on previous runs that I was pushing too hard. So no race &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; this year. But better that than pushing and injuring myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year also saw a so-far unreversed weight gain that I find incredibly frustrating. In the first six months of 2016, I gained about ten pounds—despite keeping up the same basic activity level. I attribute this to a combination of factors: metabolic shifts in my late 20s, shifting back to doing almost purely running rather than a mix of running, swimming, and cycling, and the impact of acclimation to a workout load. I’m far from overweight, but I’m also slower and generally a bit flabbier as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping 2017 is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better in all these regards! I plan to do a sprint-length triathlon and a full marathon. And I hope to lose those ten pounds again and get back to that healthier overall weight. That combo seems like the thing to do the year I turn thirty and graduate seminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 was a long, difficult, strange, sometimes wonderful and sometimes dreadful year for me. It was one of the most professionally and scholastically enjoyable and rewarding years of my life, and also one of the most exhausting. As I often do at years-end, I am taking stock publicly of what went well, what went poorly, and what I might do different in a variety of categories—here, mostly in terms of my public-facing endeavors. This year’s summing-up post will also (for, I think, the first time) include some numbers! But first, a few comments on the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/thoughts-on-2015-and-2016.html"&gt;offered a similar set of reflections&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of it, I laid out some plans for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I made the habit of writing these out formally on a day-by-day basis—and I did this off and on. If you were to look at my little (Moleskine-branded and delightful-to-me) daily planner, you’d see streaks of weeks where I noted specific tasks and whether I hit them or not, punctuated by weeks and months where I did nothing of the sort. I have always found it difficult to stick with these kinds of things, in part because I usually have a pretty good idea what I need to do on any given day without writing it down somewhere. (I use &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" title="OmniFocus"&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt; for tracking mid- and long-term deadlines for school.) In July, I started mashing this idea up with &lt;a href="http://bulletjournal.com" title="Bullet Journal site"&gt;bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and I found that I (a) really like the system and (b) also didn’t stick with it consistently. A lot of that came down to the fact that I got thrown off—horribly—by getting a mild-but-still-utterly-debilitating case of walking pneumonia in July. (On which, more in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for last year’s ideas about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I was going to hit those goals. How did I actually do at addressing them? The answer is: &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. 2016 was not an amazing year. It was not a terrible year. But it had as many downs as ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own walk with God remains &lt;em&gt;steady&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing amazing to report here, but I’m more than okay with that. I will perhaps say more on this in another post, but the older I get the more convinced I am that emotional highs are a trap. Sentiment and true religion are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same thing; and Scripture calls us to &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;spiritual feelings&lt;/em&gt;. As such, in a year with this many bumps, I am glad to say that I had no horrible falls, and I read my Bible nearly every day and prayed every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family learned some Bible verses, and started working on the Heidelberg Catechism. We shared the gospel with people as we were able, and met faithfully with our church. We were not extraordinary, and we were far from flawless, but I think we did &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. I hope and pray in God’s grace we are able to continue in faithfully doing well in the years to come. Certainly if there is one thing I hope to do more of in 2017 it is spend time with my girls. I am not a huge “kid person,” but these years are precious and go by quickly; far better to spend more time with them and have a podcast episode or a writing project go out later (or not at all) than to miss these little years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduce our system for thinking about the “structure/agency” or “systems and individuals” problem: how do the systems and structures of our lives shape us? How do we shape them? How free are we, and where are the places where more freedom is good, and the places where it might actually be bad? How do we confront the structural issues we face, or strengthen and preserve the good systems we do have in place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I embraced a weekly schedule, where each week day includes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time I get up, and a goal for how long it takes me to go from when my alarm goes off to when I have breakfast made for Jaimie and me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;half an hour of Bible reading and devotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five minutes to read the news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five minutes to plan my day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two hours of reading and writing for school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;six hours of software development work for Olo&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a specific workout in my self-designed training plan for the &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;half marathon&lt;/a&gt; I am running this fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an hour dedicated to creative projects I am working on—I’ll fill this with things like writing blog posts, prepping New Rustacean episodes, recording and editing Winning Slowly, and working on building a modern iOS and macOS app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roughly 90 minutes devoted entirely to spending time with my family, over dinner and afterward until our girls go to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;about two hours freely available—this varies enormously: it might include more of those creative endeavors, it might be just hanging out with Jaimie (watching &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; or something) for a few hours, it might be spending time with friends we have over for dinner and time afterward, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep 7–7.5 hours every single night—this is my sweet spot, so hitting it makes a big difference in being able to hit all those other marks throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of small spaces throughout the day during my &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; breaks which I use for other reading (especially news, RSS, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cut nearly all social media: Facebook, Twitter, Slack, and email all receive drastically lower amounts of time now.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; I now check once a week. I may post news stories to it, but I am basically treating it as a “write-only” medium—posting content to it but not interacting there. (I find interactions there to have a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; low ratio of value to time spent.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; I now check once a day, for no more than five minutes. It is incredibly easy to get sucked into reading my Twitter feed at great length, and far more difficult to conclude that using my time that way is remotely valuable for my goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack:&lt;/strong&gt; I now use in dedicated blocks of time. I get very good value out of Slack:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for professional use, as we use it to coordinate our work at Olo, and it’s very handy for quick interactions for a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for side projects: Stephen and I use it to coordinate and plan for &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and I also provide a fair bit of input and discussion for &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as occasionally write there (you may see something of that sort this very week, in fact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for personal use, as a virtual water cooler with a bunch of other developers in one team, and with a group of Christians in tech in another, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; helpful for staying sane while working at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All that notwithstanding, Slack can also be a huge time-sink and distraction, so I limit the blocks I use it, and try to be effective with that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; I now have closed much of the day, and only check at intervals. Especially with the way we get automated emails for various kinds of error reporting, issue tracking, and so on at work, having my mail up all day is a quick path to constant interruption. (Further minimizing notifications from email will help even more on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; thinking about how I want to treat my time on the weekends, as well: dedicated blocks of time with family, for side work I’m doing a little of, for those creative side projects, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot there, and I’ve only been at it one week. So far, however, I like it, and it’s felt like something I can sustain effectively going forward. A few things will have to be tweaked a bit when I’m in class proper in the fall, not just doing an independent study. But the main routine is very good and very helpful so far, and I intend to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other other observation on the changes themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; require a lot of discipline to stick with over the course of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was most helpful because I did take that planning time each day and set specific tasks I wanted to accomplish in that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t quite pull it off all the way; some schedule surprises Thursday and Friday threw it off. I did still get done basically everything I wanted to this week, though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also didn’t manage that full hour-long creative block every day. I managed about 30–45 minutes most days, because I found myself craving some non-thinking time right after wrapping up work. I’ll need to sort that out more as I go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect that making this an actual habit will yield huge dividends over time, but it’s going to take a while to make it &lt;em&gt;stick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section id="background" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; did I do all of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I have been feeling, increasingly keenly, the amount I have to get done (work, school, side projects like &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; and a few more simmering as well) and the amount of time I have to do it (no more than anyone else). I have also been feeling the effects of too much “multitasking,” which I increasingly recognize along with everyone else is impossible. If I am jumping back and forth between some kind of work (writing software, reading, or writing) and other activities like email, Slack, or Twitter, I simply do not get as much done. But I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a trap of thinking that productivity is the most important thing in the world. It is very American. I understand the temptation, but I do not generally indulge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about accomplishing the particular things I want to do, and doing those as well as being a good husband and dad and a faithful member of our church means using my time as effectively as I can. This is not a new concern for me, and &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html"&gt;as such I have written about it before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things I wrote about before I still do, and they work well for me. I still use OmniFocus to manage my tasks; I still use the pomodoro approach for keeping my brain moving throughout a whole day, and I still refuse to use email as a task manager (though I’ve been less disciplined about hitting “Inbox Zero” than I’d like of late). However, I found in the past few months that, while good, those habits aren’t quite &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; for everything I have going. They are necessary but insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can manage more on the school front over the weekends, that’s a win, but this breakdown is usually enough to get done everthing I need to.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olo is a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; employer. Among many other things Olo does exceptionally well, they were willing to hire me as a salaried, full-time type employee with full benefits, but working 30 hours instead of 40 while I’m finishing my M. Div. I have pro-rated pay and vacation (though, pro-rated vacation just means I have the same amount of functional time off as everyone else does), but otherwise am just like every other employee in terms of health-care, training availability, laptop, etc. Olo is the best place I’ve ever worked, bar none, and by a &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; margin.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I may have gone mad with power or something, but I launched another podcast today! Crazy, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s both more and less crazy than it might sound, though. More, because of what the podcast is, and less, because of what the podcast is. So what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run With Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a microcast, with 3–5-minute long episodes &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; running, recorded &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="//cdn.chriskrycho.com/runwith/cover-web.jpg" title="_Run With Me_ cover art" alt="Run With Me" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run With Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I allow myself an absolute maximum of ten minutes to edit and publish the episodes. (So far, I’ve never needed more than about &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; minutes.) So, for anyone worried that I’m unnecessarily or unwisely adding something more to my already-full plate: don’t be. Apart from spending some of my relaxation time this weekend building the site, the only time I’ll spend on this will be time I would already be spending running or cooling down after a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far (two episodes in!) it’s a ton of fun. I’ve enjoyed the process of recording it, and it’s nice to be able to talk about running confident that whoever listens is actually interested. (As I explain further on the show, that interest in not boring my audience is part of why I’m doing this, rather than just talking to people I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest in running, and especially if you like listening to podcasts while you run, I think you’ll enjoy this. I’d love it if you subscribed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/feed.xml"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-fw fa-rss"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Old-fashioned RSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on the podcast from a form/genre angle, and a few from a technical angel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of &lt;a href="//www.manton.org/2016/01/new-podcast-timetable.html"&gt;“microcasts”&lt;/a&gt; as being not terribly dissimilar from a &lt;a href="//www.chriskrycho.com/micro/"&gt;microblog post&lt;/a&gt; in its own way. I’m happily stealing the idea of a microcast from &lt;a href="//www.manton.org"&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="//timetable.manton.org"&gt;Timetable&lt;/a&gt; show is a delightful little thing. (It’s not original to him; a quick [Google search] will turn up instances of the term dating back several years at least, but he’s where I got the idea, and I think he’s certainly one of the first to be popularizing the form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find podcasting as a medium extremely interesting in general (I’m &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;sure&lt;/a&gt; you would &lt;a href="//www.newrustacean.com"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="//www.sap-py.com"&gt;guessed&lt;/a&gt; that), and I think microcasts will proliferate rapidly. As my friend &lt;a href="http://oluseyi.info"&gt;Oluseyi Sonaiya&lt;/a&gt; and I have often discussed, brevity is a real virtue in podcasting, and one too-little appreciated by many amateur producers in the space. &lt;a href="http://independentclauses.com"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; and I aim for that balance with &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s always been a part of my consideration with &lt;a href="//www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; as well. People’s time is valuable. Saying something and then &lt;em&gt;being done&lt;/em&gt; is a kindness to your audience.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, practically speaking, there’s the simple reality that it’s just &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to record a long-form podcast while running. Especially a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a tech level, producing the podcast is incredibly simple: I use the built-in microphone in the headphones that come with an iPhone to record, and do the recording and (extremely minimal) audio production in &lt;a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1001l4KM"&gt;Ferrite&lt;/a&gt;. When I say minimal, I mean really minimal: I chop off the bits before I start talking, and the bits after I start talking, and I do all of that on my iPhone. Then I export to Dropbox, and from there to my CDN. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

So I responded a little: I posted publicly about it on Twitter, making known my intention to find some ways within the podcast to feature female Rust developers, just to help make the Rust community that much friendlier to women. (I’m &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/686150249619013632"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; that it’s actually very welcoming so far, for which I’m grateful!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was gratifying in some ways: I got a fair bit of response from within the Rust community, and heard back from a number of women who listen to the show. At least one of them linked to the show, recommending it strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy about this. And then I started thinking about the way this cycle played out. Everything in it was genuinely well-intended on my part. I very much want to see the tech world in general and open-source software in particular be friendlier and kinder and more respectful to women. I want it to be a genuinely egalitarian space. I would go so far as to say that I think that is essential for it to be a genuinely &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if those &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; my intentions? What if, in point of fact, I was a misogynist pig with a penchant for sexual harassment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same social media tactics would still work. People who’d experienced my wickedness first-hand would know better, but many wouldn’t. I’d just be a friendly-sounding voice out there on the internet, giving every impression of being on the side of people whose go of things in the tech community has been pretty rough at times. My stature would go up as a consequence. My podcast would grow in popularity. The likely hood of my being a well-liked and well-respected member of the community would only increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the opportunities I would have to abuse that position of influence would all concomitantly increase as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; me. But unless you know me and see how I live my life, you don’t know that. You don’t know from a tweet, or a blog post, or even a whole public internet history. Sad to say, but &lt;em&gt;people lie&lt;/em&gt;, and they do it for many reasons. When, in the midst of any furor over another revelation of sexual predation from a well-regarded person who has said all the right things, remember that words are cheap. “Actions speak louder than words” is a truism for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you should mistrust everything you hear or read. It doesn’t mean that behind every nice-seeming person on the internet is actually a creepy psychopath plotting how to manipulate you. It just means that you shouldn’t be surprised to find that, out of the great mass of people who genuinely are friendly and helpful, there are nonetheless a few for whom their friendliness and helpfulness are a manipulative charade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep trusting people. You can’t live your life sanely otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don’t be surprised when some people aren’t what they seem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone acts one way in public but is completely different in private, do whatever you can to deal with it. Above all, if you’re their friend, &lt;em&gt;call them on it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give grace; people make mistakes. But also don’t assume that just because someone who’s lied repeatedly apologizes, they’re going to change. Giving grace and forgiving people doesn’t mean being blind or naïve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t manipulate people. It’s easy to do it, and the temptation toward popularity can get tangled up even with genuine desires to do good in ways that profoundly complicate your actions. Watch out for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let that worry keep you from doing good things for other peoples’ good. Keep your eyes on your own motives while you do it, but &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A34-40&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;love others as you love yourself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

At the start of the year, I posted a number of goals for my “public” life this year, and I also wrote up a number of personal goals for myself. Goals are well and good, but if I do not evaluate how I did on them, and think about areas I succeeded and areas I failed, and on how I might do better in the future, those goals will not make much difference. (&lt;em&gt;Much&lt;/em&gt; difference, I say, because I have long found that even just having goals makes a difference in how I approach the year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, I posted a list of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/public-ish-plans.html"&gt;“Public-ish Plans”&lt;/a&gt;. My self-evaluation on those counts isn’t amazing. The Winning Slowly goals, I managed: we have separate pages for each season, and we recorded two more seasons—each one better than those before. Hosting things on Digital Ocean and migrating my wife’s blogs off of Blogger and WordPress, not so much (read: not at all, though I did &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; writing a Ghost theme for her current WordPress site… and haven’t touched it in at least six months.) I wrote some music this year, but not three minutes worth—you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; hear all 37 seconds of it &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/chriskrycho"&gt;on SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/poetry/"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt;; I managed to average about one poem a month starting in March. I wrote a few essays, but nothing close to one per month. I posted a whopping two book reviews (out of the six I hoped for), and both of those were written for school. I managed to add a picture to the About page, but I didn’t even come close to blogging about the family on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum: about 50/50 on those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I managed quite a few other things &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on that list this year. I started learning Rust, and started &lt;a href="http://newrustacean.com/"&gt;a podcast about it&lt;/a&gt; which is easily the most successful online endeavor I’ve ever undertaken, with a good 500 regular listeners. (That’s a small crowd on the internet, but massively more than any writing I’ve done, and actually larger than Winning Slowly’s current audience.) I have basically carried home a major transition effort for my main software development client, and helped them bring a new developer up to speed. I landed a new software development job, doing things I’m much more passionate about, which I’ll be starting in mid-January. I ran a triathlon (and placed third in my age group), and I set another personal record in the half-marathon I ran this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons I take away from this last year, then, is that it’s important to set goals, but it’s also important to let those goals change over time. Some of those goals are still things I’d like to accomplish—like migrating us to DigitalOcean, and getting Jaimie’s sites off of Blogger especially. Another (fairly obvious one) is prioritizing. I had a lot of major goals for last year, and in retrospect, I think I had &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt;. It’s hard to keep all of those in sight of the course of the year, especially with other professional and scholastic demands to meet (themselves often good in their own right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these things in mind, I’m planning to approach 2016 a little differently. I haven’t made formal goals yet, but I have come up with the basic outline I want to use going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this list is intentionally &lt;em&gt;unordered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My spiritual life remains the highest priority, because if my walk with God falters, everything else will go amok. Beyond that, however, the amount of time and effort I invest in each category not only can but should vary over time. Family will broadly remain in the second of those slots, though there may be days or the occasional week where one of the other concerns &lt;em&gt;very temporarily&lt;/em&gt; takes a higher priority. The others will adjust relative to each other as need be: there will be times when school requires more, and so my own writing gets less time, and there will be times when I have more flexibility and so am able to devote more to those personal interests, and so on. The goal here is not the mythical notion of “balance” but rather faithfulness, which has some superficial similarities but ultimately &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/faithfulness.html"&gt;plays out rather differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping, in light of those goals, to set annual, monthly, and daily goals in each of those categories. The daily goals should help me move toward the monthly goals, and the monthly goals toward the yearly goals. I only get to set one goal in each of those categories for each tier: at five goals, that’s already plenty! I hope that evaluating each day will help me be more focused and faithful, and that situating daily and monthly goals each in light of larger goals will help me actually accomplish those larger goals. We’ll see how it goes, of course. I’ll be back in a week or so with whatever goals I decide to make public in those categories, and again in a year with an evaluation rather like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

I finished at 1:24:58, which comes out to be about a 6:29/mile pace. I finished 20th overall, out of thousands of half-marathoners. If that seems fast to you, well, it seems fast to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask me how I run so far and so quickly. I always laugh when they ask, because for my part, I haven’t thought of myself as particularly fast—the guys who finished first in my race this year ran over a minute per mile faster than me.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The best half-marathoners in the world are running a 4:30/mile pace! But I grant that a 6:29/mile pace is, in the grand scheme of things, pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reason I don’t tend to think of myself as fast: my training approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My half marathon times have always been pretty good,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because I am particularly athletic. As I mentioned in &lt;a href="/2015/how-i-became-a-runner.html"&gt;my first post&lt;/a&gt; in this series: you can ask my high school football coaches. I was never particularly quick, and even now my best mile time is somewhere around 5:30. I knew people even in high school who were in the mid- to low-4:00 range. Still, going sub-6:30 for 13 miles is no joke, and if you had told me even five years ago—after I started running!—that someday I would run the race I did a few weeks ago, I’d have laughed in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really is all in the training. I have two things going for me, and only two: I train &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;, and I train &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency first: year-round, I am doing some sort of workout six days a week. Throughout the winter and spring, that will look like a mix of running, spin classes at the gym, and swimming as I prep for another triathlon. From now till the end of January or so, I’ll just do pretty much whatever I feel like in that mix, while keeping at it. From February till whatever point early next summer that my triathlon is, I’ll dedicate two workouts a week to each of the sports. Then I’ll slowly transition to nearly-all running. Through the fall, I will run 5–6 days a week, cycling for a commute when weather permits one of those days instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That right there is the single biggest factor in my performance. If &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; did 30–45 minutes a day four days a week, an hour one day a week, and ninety minutes to two hours another day a week, he would get quicker rapidly. If he did that for five and a half years (as I have been), he would likely be in very similar shape to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for training smart, I basically just follow the &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;Maffetone method&lt;/a&gt;. Most of my runs are easy, aerobic runs. Even at the height of my training for a half marathon, when I am running 45–50 miles each week, 80% of my miles are at a conversational pace. (I’ve carried on fifteen-minute-long phone conversations on runs before!) My long runs include a hard, roughly race-pace finish for the last three or four miles, and I do one hard run a week which is half aerobic and half pushing harder than race speed.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But overall, I run a slow-for-me pace most of the time. I use a heart-rate monitor to help me stay in an easy, aerobic training zone, and I simply don’t go over that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That slow-run training pays off in a couple ways. First, it builds up my body’s ability to process energy aerobically (see &lt;a href="http://philmaffetone.com/what-is-the-maffetone-method/"&gt;the Maffetone method article&lt;/a&gt; for details). Second, it’s much easier on my body—I simply don’t have the joint problems or soreness that many runners do. Third, it is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier mentally, because I can enjoy my runs and not feel exhausted after them. That means it’s much easier to do them day after day, and that takes me back to the consistency point from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to run fast: run a lot, and usually run slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top finisher came in at 1:10:03 (to my 1:24:48)—a 5:21/mile pace. The record on the course—which isn’t a perfect match for what we ran today, but pretty similar—is 1:04:21, which is about a 4:55 pace. That’s &lt;em&gt;blisteringly&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my first, in December 2011, I ran a 1:36:32, which is about a 7:23 pace.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally through speed work days; this fall I did one day of hill repeats: a quarter mile pushing &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; up a hill, a quarter mile easy back down the hill, and a minute of rest. Five miles of that is tough; I’d like to do more in future years.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

In three weeks, I’ll run my seventh half marathon,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I finished my first triathlon last summer. So, yes, I do run a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a little strange to me. I came to running late, and in a roundabout way. Many of my friends ran cross country in high school; I played football (and poorly at that) instead. I ran off and on in college in a (mostly failing) attempt to stay in shape and avoid college weight. The only running I did consistently was playing Ultimate on Fridays with some friends. For the first year I was out of college, my routine was much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I got mono. I drank after a friend who carries around a particularly virulent strain of it, and was down for the count: a month in bed, and two months of recovery after that. I was, in theory, the captain of a church league Ultimate team that spring. I missed half the games, and even when I was able to attend some of them in the latter half of the season, it left me literally needing a nap just to stand and watch for an hour. In the hopes of being back in good enough shape to play the following fall, I started running as soon as I was cleared by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first run on a treadmill in May 2010 was painfully slow. Even when I was furthest out of shape before that, running an 8-minute mile had been doable—painful, perhaps, but doable. That day I ran a 12-minute mile, and was done for the day. The same thing another day that week. And again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But slowly, over time, I built up my endurance. I managed to run two miles outside a few weeks later. By the time Ultimate season rolled around in late August, I could run five miles, and was doing three to five miles four times a week. I was in good enough shape to play Ultimate, and I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I found running hard, and didn’t particularly enjoy it. I ran solely as a means to the end of playing Ultimate. More, five miles was my upper limit if I ran hard (as I always did). When I thought about people who ran half-marathons—still less the full—I simply could not understand how they did it. But I started to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I had one simple conversation, which changed my entire approach to running. It set me on a course to this seventh half-marathon, and to being “that runner guy” around here. It led to my being the healthiest I’ve ever been. And, strangest of all, it ended up with my &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; to run—and not because I like pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more on that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

In this particular season of life, that has often meant …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a lot more than a month since the promised monthly update. I’ll blame it on a lack of self-discipline… or perhaps on the presence thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, we face choices about where to spend our time. In this particular season of life, that has often meant not writing, even things I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to write. I have a family to care for, a church to serve, work to do, and schoolwork to accomplish. Family is a daily endeavor, work and school nearly so, and church regular if not quite daily. In the midst of that, I have to decide: &lt;em&gt;What will I do today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture tends to put the question in terms of balance; my friend and pastor Ashok Nachnani suggested to me a while back that it is better to think in terms of &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;. “Balance” suggests holding all these things in equal proportion, juggling them against each other. “Faithfulness” suggests fulfilling the responsibilities as best we can, with the time we are given. The actual day-to-day outcome may not look particularly different, but it is an important shift in the way we think nonetheless. To be faithful may mean letting some desireable things go, and it may mean doing some things in a different way or to a lesser degree than we might like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing. I like keeping a public record for my friends and family to see how my life is. I enjoy stretching my mental muscles in the way that writing requires. I enjoy thinking through pen or keyboard. But faithfulness to the responsibilities God has given me right now means &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trying to balance those desires against each other, and instead doing what is best for my family and my church. For the most part, right now that means not writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I put it to Jaimie a while back, at this point in life I have time for one hobby—and only one. That hobby, at this point, is fitness. I run half marathons, and now I do triathlons (first one coming up in 10 days!). That takes up a non-trivial amount of time every week. It helps me in the other areas of my life, to be sure: it helps me be less physically tired, improves my focus in school and work, and serves to maintain my health. Nonetheless, it is hobby-like and it takes a substantial amount of time every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now, I write a great deal less than I want, and a great deal less than I did in college or early in our marriage. I miss the days when I had time to work on poetry for hours at a stretch, or simply to muse for a few thousand words. But it is far more important for me to spend time with Ellie and Kate than it is to write poetry, or to compose music, right now. Lord willing, I have 55–60 years ahead of me. Of those years, they will be close only another 15–20, and they will be the age they are today &lt;em&gt;only for today&lt;/em&gt;. As much as writing and composing and hobby programming all look appealing to me, and as much as those really are good expressions of the ways God has gifted me, focusing on them would not be the most &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; use of my time—not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that writing and composing and developing interesting software are not important. Rather: they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good and valuable things. But they are things to focus on at other times in life. As fast as this life goes, and I am increasingly aware that it goes quickly indeed, I can expect in the ordinary course of things to have &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; years available for those things. I can exercise my gifts faithfully in the right time and season. Today, I can learn to love my little girls well, invest deeply in their lives, and savor moments that will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I must remind myself that teaching and shaping them is easily the most significant thing I will ever do. Should I write an essay that persuaded a thousand people to change their views on the arts, or to adopt a better view of the church, still my impact on two little lives would be more important. If I can point them faithfully to Christ and help them learn to walk faithfully with him as healthy members of his body, that will be a good life to have lived. Everything else is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icing is good, for the record. Sometimes, in these sorts of posts, we can mistake &lt;em&gt;relative importance&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;absolute importance&lt;/em&gt;. I should, at various times in my life, make sure to exercise the good gifts God has given me in ways appropriate to that time and context. Right now, that means continuing to write, but less frequently. In the future, it will mean something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this must stand in the context of resurrection hope. Too often, I live—too often, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; live—as though the next 60 years are all we may expect, the only time for writing and composing and so on. But it is not. I look forward to endless ages of creativity, exercising those gifts &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fully than I am able now. So: Lord Jesus, come soon. And in the meantime, may I be faithful in each season to do as well as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

I came out with something much, much more valuable.
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of April, I flew out to Seattle to &lt;a href="//www.chriskrycho.com/2015/tolle-lege.html"&gt;give a talk&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="//bibletechconference.com"&gt;BibleTech&lt;/a&gt;, a conference hosted by Faithlife (the company that owns Logos Bible Software). What I found was not only a bunch of interesting content—though there was certainly plenty of that, and props to the Logos/Faithlife people for putting on a great event—but also an awful lot of people &lt;em&gt;a lot like me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me well know this is rare. Finding people who share &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of my primary interests &lt;em&gt;and approach it the same way I do&lt;/em&gt; is relatively rare. Finding people who share an interest is not especially hard, but that qualification is extraordinarily important: I know lots of people interested in programming, and lots of people interested in theology, and not many at all who approach either the same way I do. Finding people who are interested in both software &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; theology (still less also music and linguistics and so on) has been so rare as to be a point of quiet but significant and ongoing frustration in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I went to BibleTech, and met a lot of amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reflecting on the experience today—thinking about why I’ve so deeply enjoyed not only the conference itself but &lt;a href="//bibletechnology-slack.herokuapp.com/"&gt;the community&lt;/a&gt; that has sprung out of it—I realized: &lt;em&gt;These are my people.&lt;/em&gt; They share a passion for software development, theology, linguistics, and in many cases even music. There may not be many of us in the world, but a substantial number were assembled in Seattle April 30–May 1, 2015. That’s no small thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the future holds for me—whether it will continue to include writing software for the Bible specifically or not—but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that this phase of my life has been enormously beneficial in this one way if in no others. It is nice to find kindred spirits in the world, and to know that, even if I am pretty strange, there are other strange people out there, too, and that we can keep working in our strange ways to make the Word of God more available and more useful to people every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good work, BibleTech.&lt;/p&gt;

This doesn’t excuse riots, but it sure as heck &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; them. Baltimore is broken, but primarily in a massive system of abuse. Yes, pray for peace.

&lt;p&gt;February marked the final burst of winter here. We had a number of days of wintry weather, leading to several days where Southeastern’s campus was closed—though none on days when I had class! One of those days included well over doc inches of snow, and marked the first time Ellie has ever been able to play in the snow. Though she was a little nervous at first, she loosened up as she watched a neighbor kid play and was soon having a blast working on snowmen and a snow fort. She even tried to throw a few snowballs, but—like her momma—she didn’t much care for having them tossed her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate quite enjoyed the snow as well, even though her snow clothes were still a bit too big for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept plugging away at work and school. His past week was Spring Break for us, but “breaks” here usually just mark an opportunity for me to get ahead on my class assignments. I wrote one of my three papers for the semester—the shortest, but it’s helpful to have it out of the way nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week also saw our friends PJ and Katie finish packing up their apartment here to &lt;a href="http://www.adoptedbytheking.com/2015/03/from-wake-forest-with-love.html"&gt;move to Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and we helped them wrap that up and participated in a few get-togethers to give them a good send-off. We are simultaneously glad for them, because this seems like it will be a very good thing for them, and incredibly sad, because we will miss them dearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good friends are a rare and precious thing, and we have been blessed in ways that are hard to describe in our friendship with PJ and Katie. Having them live in the same town as us for that past couple years, and then less than a mile away for the last year, has been wonderful. We are blessed to live in a time when it is easy to stay in touch, of course, but no amount of Skype or FaceTime can make up for being unable to share a meal. Gladly, we are hoping to see them again in just a few months at the Southern Baptist Convention (which I am planning to attend for class credit at SEBTS), and that softens the blow, if only a little. Too, they are moving to be only about 90 minutes’ drive from where Jaimie’s parents live, so we will certainly see them when we visit there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I am sad, and so is Jaimie. Ellie hasn’t really understood it yet, but she will no doubt be sad as it comes home to her over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it goes until Christ comes again. &lt;em&gt;Maranatha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I left it aside because it certainly wasn’t Barrs’ fault, and would have seemed absurdly nitpicky to my audience there. But it bears comment nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small caps! The divine name appeared in a number of places throughout the books, as &lt;span class="smcp"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; (just as it does in the Bible). Unfortunately, Crossway chose to use a Palatino variant without real &lt;a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2008/02/20/small-caps/"&gt;small capitals&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I know: it’s a little detail, and in the grand scheme of things it isn’t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; important. But it’s the little details like that which add up to the difference between a so-so printing of a book and a truly delightful printing of a book. They make a big difference in the experience of reading the book (albeit usually a subconscious one, unless like me you are a typography nerd). I think that a book on the arts, of all books, should have really delightful typesetting. (Honestly, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; books should have good typesetting, but the lack is even less excusable when the book is about beauty!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I started reading Bruce Ashford’s new book, &lt;em&gt;Every Square Inch&lt;/em&gt;. Five pages in, I’m enjoying his writing so far, but two things are making it a less-than-delightful experience. One is the typeface—the same custom serif used in Logos. It is functional, but there are many irritating details about it. Above all, it screams that it was designed for screens and has not been adjusted for use in print. The other major issue is the page margins. The inner margins are perfectly respectable; the outer margins are so narrow that my much-less-typographically-obsessive wife &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; immediately noted and commented on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things matter. The old patterns of book-printing—careful designs of everything from leading to line length to the size of margins—were patterns for a reason. In the new digital-everything era, too many of these lessons have been forgotten or ignored by startup presses, and it’s making everyone’s reading experience unnecessarily worse. Typography is a skill and an art that can make an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; difference in the experience of reading a book; it is one we need publishers like Lexham Press and Crossway to reappropriate.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over. But please, publishers: work to make your typography &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;, not just passable. Pay attention to your margins and your small capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossway I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; can do it, because their ESV line includes some of the best Bible typesetting done by &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. They just need to apply that everywhere!&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I resolved at the beginning of the year to write at least one update every month, though. I want these updates here for &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;, if for no other reason. (Then, of course, I promptly missed January, but this is counting for that; there will be another post here at the end of the month.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have we been up to, you ask? Well, quite a lot! Since the last time I wrote a blog post, we had a baby, who is now crawling around. (If you’re reading this, you probably already know that, of course.) Ellie is talking, constantly practicing saying things the right way and asking the names of things; Kate is scooting around the floor exploring everything and is increasingly verbal herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They love playing together. Ellie and Kate are good friends—a while back Jaimie heard Ellie quietly talking to Katie in the back seat of the car, repeating, “You’re my best friend, Kate.” Sometimes when Ellie gives Kate a hug and a kiss goodnight every night, Kate goes into the most adorable squeals of delight. Indeed, no one elicits those squeals as much as Ellie. In addition to her scooting around the floor, Kate is happily eating solid foods—and the girl &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; her food. Today I put her in her high chair and she started laughing as I put the tray in front of her. She often thumps the tray, the table, or the floor to express her joy. And last but not least, this little gal is &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt;. Her favorite time is getting in a bouncer and jumping for as long as we will let her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/girls-games.jpg" title="My ladies playing Lego Star Wars"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
My ladies playing &lt;i&gt;Lego Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been teaching Ellie a lot. Jaimie has slowly started working through the ABCs with her. She can count to 5, and she knows her way to 10, but sometimes gets sidetracked along the way. She is learning her colors and spent a while defaulting to calling everything “pink”… except for her favorite &lt;em&gt;purple&lt;/em&gt; dress. In the last month, she has started being able to identify the colors more reliably, along with lots of shapes. She loves cars and trucks and especially buses and fire trucks. She sings to herself and dances all the time. She loves building with blocks. She is learning to say “please” and “thank you”—learning, in this case, not because she doesn’t know how but because she has started &lt;em&gt;forgetting&lt;/em&gt;. She is learning to pray and to sing to God and learning the answer to simple questions like, “Who made you, Ellie?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie has continued to write off and on, though the first many months we had Kate it was much spottier than it had been. She’s working on secret projects that are making her happy, and that makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why she didn’t get as much time, I was &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; last semester. I picked up a second contract, building the new &lt;a href="//holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;, and between that and my ongoing contract work and my one class, I pulled a lot of 50–60 hour weeks. That’s not particularly an experience we are keen to repeat, but it was the right call at the time: we were able to save up the money to fill up our six-month emergency fund and to pay for the rest of seminary. This semester is going a bit easier: I am taking Hebrew III and Baptist History and working ~30 hours a week instead of ~50–55. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; my language classes; without a doubt Hebrew III and Greek III have been my very favorite classes since I started seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran another half marathon in November, and set a PR at 1:25:37—a 6:32/mile pace. I was super happy with that outcome, and I plan to run the same race again for the third year in a row this coming fall, Lord willing. In the meantime, I have started swimming and cycling regularly with the aim of completing my first triathlon early this summer. (I’m going to stick to a short “sprint” tri to start, and work up from there.) While I love running, I would like to have the use of my joints in twenty (and forty, and sixty) years, and accordingly I need to make sure I do not keep putting over 1,000 miles a year on my legs. I have been going to a spinning class to get my legs in better cycling shape for the last month (and the last two weeks Jaimie has come with me!). We have also been doing a Pilates class weekly; my back needs to be a lot stronger and my legs a lot looser, and that is helping quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to be extremely happy in our church here, FBC Durham. God has used our church to encourage and challenge us in a wide variety of ways—too many (and perhaps in many cases too subtle) even to summarize. We are excited to see what the years ahead hold for us there, as the church itself continues to flourish and grow and we seek opportunities to continue serving and building up this particular outpost of the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, life is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. It is not perfect, of course; I long for Jesus’ return and the New Heavens and New Earth more and more all the time. But we see God’s faithfulness and goodness in the hard months no less than in the easy ones. We see the Spirit working in our hearts to make us more like Christ, and it is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but a thousand words is enough. More again, and sooner than the last gap!&lt;/p&gt;

It's quite the journey!</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class="editorial"&gt;Note: This started out as a &lt;a href="https://alpha.app.net/chriskrycho/post/47820144"&gt;series of posts on App.net&lt;/a&gt;, but as I realized that it was growing a bit, I decided to &lt;a href="/2014/a-few-theses-on-blogging.html"&gt;take my own advice&lt;/a&gt; and turn it into a short blog post. (The first four paragraphs of this post are the same as the posts that spawned it.) And then, as so often happens with my writing, it rather took on a life of its own. So much for short.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wrestling with Bitbucket issues again all day, I think I’ve finally hit the breaking point. Time to go ahead and drop the money on GitHub and migrate my private repos there. (Yes, GitLab is neat, but tool integrations matter, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m also probably going to spring for a small subscription to Pivotal Tracker. It’s cheaper to do GitHub+PivotalTracker at my scale than to host GitLab and run YouTrack on a VPS. And that’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; counting my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing with Pivotal is that I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the ability to estimate more effectively even than something like Trello affords (and I don’t want to spend time wrangling with Chrome plugins), and it gives me that. Totally worth the cost in saved pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for GitHub as compared to the free GitLab… well, honestly, the F/OSS-copycat model bothers me on a lot of levels. The fact that their strategy is “copy GitHub as closely as possible, and charge for it” is not my idea of “winning slowly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(“Winning slowly” is more than just the name of my &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it’s the opposite: we named the podcast that because it’s one of the core commitments in our lives.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to pay for Pivotal and GitHub. My time is worth something, and the quality of the tools I use matters, too. Ongoing irritation and frustration adds up over time. Good tools can make us happier. Bad tools can make work more frustrating than it needs to be. Given just how frustrating work can be anyway, the last thing in the world I want to do is unnecessarily spend my time being even more frustrated by my tools. And you know what? $7/month for each of those tools is absolutely worth more than the frustration of wrestling with tools that do the job less well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actually really excited by this. Pivotal Tracker will help me avoid making the painful mistake of underestimation in the future, by helping me see how long things actually take and giving me a way to plan out major projects with that data immediately available. GitHub will be simultaenously more functional and much lovelier than Bitbucket—no strategy tax holding it back!—and will be much nicer to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it comes down to this: I’m happy to pay for good tools that make my work more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise and amusement, this leads me to a closely related point I had been writing up in a separate blog post: the value of tools that &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;. It is not merely that bad tools make work unpleasant. Good tools can make work a &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, because my vocations is such a significant part of my life, few things bring me as much simple pleasure as a tool that does its job well, is pleasant to use, and is beautiful, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest example of this for me is &lt;a href="//www.neat.io/bee/index.html"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;, a tool designed to make working with issue trackers like JIRA, GitHub Issues, and FogBugz easier and more pleasant. I use JIRA for one of my long-term contracts—I actually set it up for the company—and I have a love-hate relationship with it. JIRA’s power is great, but the web interface is slow and cluttered.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used other desktop tools with JIRA before, and they were even worse than the web interface. I stumbled across Bee the other day (I cannot even remember how!), decided to try it out, and fell in love. It is simple, fast, and &lt;em&gt;elegant&lt;/em&gt;. That is a killer combination. I have been using it daily for over a week, and strange though it might be to say of a desktop client for issue trackers, I get genuine pleasure out of using it. (Yes, I know: that is a bit strange.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the same experience with a number of other tools I use—&lt;a href="//www.git-tower.com"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="//bywordapp.com"&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="//www.jetbrains.com/idea/"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; to name just a few. This very post is written in Byword, and I’m &lt;em&gt;happy&lt;/em&gt; about it. I wish I felt that way about every tool I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this goes beyond software. I have had the same experience driving a car. The Mazda3 I drove in and after college was a delight. The MUV&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we drive right now is sufficient. The Chevy Malibu we rented for driving to and from Texas in December was &lt;em&gt;irritating&lt;/em&gt;, with an inordinate number of small failures to consider how the thing would actually be used. I would buy another Mazda3 in a heartbeat; I would contentedly take another Lexus RX300-alike; I would avoid a Chevy Malibu like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; category of tool is like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between a poor or mediocre tool and a good tool can make the difference between frustration and satisfaction. The difference between a good tool and a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; tool can make the difference between satisfaction and delight. That inspires me: it makes me want to make things so that they do more than &lt;em&gt;suffice&lt;/em&gt;—so that they &lt;em&gt;excel&lt;/em&gt;, so that they delight and energize their audience. Whether that is someone using a web application I write or someone listening to a piece of music I composed, I want them to experience more than good-enough. I want them to feel joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something profound here, I think, something that goes even deeper than just the experience of being happy enough with a good tool to pay money to use it. I think human beings are meant for that profound joy—meant for it in every breath. That these kinds of delights are rare, and so often marred even at their best by little failures, is a mark of the imperfection—and, in human terms at least, the &lt;em&gt;imperfectibility&lt;/em&gt;—of the world in which we live. But the fact that such moments will be rare until the eschaton neither undoes nor diminishes the imperative to strive after them—especially for those of us who, as Christians, affirm the goodness and the &lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt; of the created world. Quite the contrary. We have a responsibility and a charge as subcreators always to be able to say of the work we have done, “It is good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not there yet. I hope very much, though, that the work I do this year will be—for at least one person—a little sip from that deep well of delight. Whether I succeed or no, at least the bar is set where it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;

While New Years’ resolutions can be silly and get us in trouble (when we set unrealistic goals, or unhelpful goals), the turning of the year can also be a helpful time to evaluate the way we spend our time and the things we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a list of public-ish things I am &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; to manage in 2015, in no particular order. Come the end of the year, I will Lord willing look back and see which of these I was able to pull off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish at least two seasons of &lt;a href="//www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="//stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; just as we did last year—but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the site for Winning Slowly updated so that it paginates between seasons! This means writing an extension for &lt;a href="//docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; that can paginate on something besides page count. An excuse to write Python? I call that winning.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrate Jaimie’s &lt;a href="//jaimiekrycho.com"&gt;Jaimie’s professional writing website&lt;/a&gt; from WordPress to &lt;a href="//ghost.org"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. (Maybe do something similar with her current &lt;a href="//jaimiedawn.blogspot.com"&gt;personal site&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on Blogger. Yuck.) I’ve gotten a bit of a start on that already, and I hope to knock it out sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get to a point where I’m hosting all my own sites on my own DigitalOcean droplet (or similar). I’ve been moving that direction slowly but steadily anyway—whereas I started and ran for a long time on simple shared hosting, I’ve been using &lt;a href="https://www.webfaction.com/?aid=67929"&gt;Webfaction&lt;/a&gt; for a good chunk of the past year, and now am pretty well ready to take the plunge this year into just running my own server. No skin off their backs; Webfaction has been great, as was &lt;a href="https://billing.stablehost.com/aff.php?aff=319"&gt;StableHost&lt;/a&gt; before them. I’m just ready to be in control (even with the bit of extra maintenance that entails).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write at least three minutes of music, and post it to my &lt;a href="//soundcloud.com/chriskrycho"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; account. Preferably five minutes, but at least three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write some poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a substantive essay and post it at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post at least a half dozen book reviews (which, among other things, means reading at least a half dozen books worth reviewing). These can be fiction or non-fiction. Personally, I’d like to get everything from Dostoevsky to Schreiner in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a picture to my &lt;a href="/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post a &lt;a href="/family"&gt;#family&lt;/a&gt; update at least once a month. It’ll be good for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, just to have a better way of tracking what’s going on with our little gals, and I know my family would enjoy it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, I’d like to be doing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in nearly every public-facing category in which I’m interested. Maybe it won’t be a lot, but keeping my musical skills doing matters to me. Keeping my brain engaged on a wide variety of topics matters to me. Keeping my writing skills sharp matters to me. I cannot &lt;em&gt;excel&lt;/em&gt; at all of those things, certainly—especially not if I wish to be a good husband and father! But keeping them active means keeping them from further atrophying, and that is something, at least. It will hopefully leave them more available to me for times in the future when I am able to dedicate more time to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 2014 and 2013 were both years in which I focused primarily on software—and all to the good!—then I hope 2015 will be a year in which I am able to broaden out again and focus on a wider variety of things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll note that there really aren’t any purely personal goals on this list. Not to worry: I have them, and I intend to formalize them in the next couple of days. But one of the things I have learned over the many years I have been blogging is that not everything needs to be public. Some things can be; indeed, some &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. Some things &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be public but &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; not, and yet others &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; be public. Right now, I am choosing to leave quite a few things in the “may be need not” category private. (This direction, I can always change my mind later. It’s essentially impossible to do the opposite in the internet era.)&lt;/p&gt;

Here's how. (To-do lists, Inbox Zero, and pomodoros!)</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This fall, I have had a lot on my plate: building HolyBible.com, continuing to work for Quest Consultants, and doing a pastoral ministry internship. I needed to be more productive—a lot more. Happily, I have been, and it only took three small changes.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="use-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use a To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a list of items to accomplish has been incredibly helpful. I started using &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; in August for class due dates and any work tasks not tracked in other ways.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At that point, I organized everything—a bit too much, actually. Over the last couple months, I took some good advice I have seen in a number of places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not over-organize. Most tasks can go in a simple inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit your due dates. Making it a habit to hit every due date will help you not to miss important tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not put due dates on things that do not need them. You will eventually stop paying attention to them—and also to the due dates that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to knock out a few small things from my Inbox every day, and hit all the due dates I set for myself. I am missing fewer things, getting more things done, and getting them done sooner than I did before. I like my app, but I know people who have just used an old-fashioned planner. The trick is to find a strategy that works for you.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="email-is-not-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Is &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; A To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I got in the habit of using my email as a to-do list. In theory, seeing a list of unanswered emails every day should have motivated me to respond to them. In reality, they just sat there and slowly piled up. At best, they nagged at me. At worst, I basically forgot them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using OmniFocus, I killed this habit. Now I make a task for anything I need to act on, and I delete or archive everything else.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If the task is time-sensitive, I put a due date on it; otherwise, my third rule above applies. I also have a repeating task reminding me to empty my inbox at the end of each day (“Inbox Zero”). Having an empty inbox at the end of every day removes a certain amount of mental baggage: I have a task for everything I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="take-breaks" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have started using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;“pomodoro”&lt;/a&gt; technique. The basic approach is to work steadily for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After four such cycles, I take a slightly longer break—usually 15 minutes. On each break, I walk around and do something unrelated to whatever I am working on. I also write down a brief summary of what I did on that cycle.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is nothing complicated about this: I just use a simple timer to track the work and break cycles.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have seen a &lt;em&gt;dramatic&lt;/em&gt; improvement in my ability to sustain my concentration on my tasks throughout the day since I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for that improvement. First, I have dedicated break times, so I know that I can go check social media, read tech and news sites, etc. &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;. That makes it easier to concentrate on work for the blocks in between; the distractions can wait. Second, it puts a limit on those break times. We have all been surprised to find we have lost an hour reading online; using a timer helps prevent that. Third, getting up and moving around helps keep my brain active—I can tell that the movement considerably improves my alertness and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These breaks have other benefits, too. There is mounting evidence that sitting all day is terrible for our health. Even exercising as much as I do &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/25/135575490/sitting-all-day-worse-for-you-than-you-might-think" title="Sitting All Day: Worse For You Than You Might Think"&gt;cannot fully counteract&lt;/a&gt; a sedentary lifestyle. However, there is also evidence that getting up and moving on a regular basis &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help. Walking briskly, I usually manage a fifth or a quarter of a mile on a five-minute break. That adds up over the course of a day: if I am disciplined about walking on my breaks, I regularly walk 2–3 miles in a day, even with lunch and other non-walking breaks in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also found the breaks spiritually helpful. One of the requirements for my pastoral ministry internship was to memorize Ephesians. Five-minute breaks are &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for memorizing and reviewing Scripture, so I was able to be productive on those breaks, even while letting my brain relax from my other work. It is similarly useful for dedicated times of prayer throughout the day. The combination of scripture memory and prayer has been invaluable in combatting sin and stirring up my affections for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I get a triple benefit by doing pomodoros. I am more productive when I am working, my body will remain healthier because I am less sedentary, and I am growing in holiness and intimacy with God. Of all the changes I made this semester, incorporating pomodoros into my day has been the most important, and I plan to make it a regular part of my life henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just what I do. It may not work for you. It may even drive you crazy.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., things not covered by JIRA, Trello, Bitbucket issues, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; suits me, I would recommend &lt;a href="https://en.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; to most people instead: it is less expensive and easier to use, and while it does not do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; OmniFocus does, it can easily do everything most people need.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I archive order confirmations, messages from friends, and work conversations, and delete everything else.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the 25/5 pattern? That seems to be a limit in human cognition; it lines up closely with research on student attention spans in the classroom.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps me see what I have done over the course of a day and gives me a sense of progress. It is also extremely useful when writing up a weekly report for an employer.&lt;a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="http://www.tomighty.org/"&gt;Tomighty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12"&gt;Pomodoro One&lt;/a&gt;, which are both free and work well. The app is not the point, though: an old-fashioned kitchen timer will do just as well.&lt;a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, I heard back from a then-potential and now-actual client who hired me and a friend to design and build a web application for them. They are going to pay us a substantial sum to do it. This is &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. I have been hoping this particular opportunity would come through, because everything about it is appealing to me. It is an interesting application; I like the material it involves (a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;); I will learn a bit along the way; I will get to stretch my front-end design chops again; I will make some seriously good money at it. I am, in a word, stoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward four and a half hours. Jaimie and I are helping Ellie wrap up her evening activities and getting ready to take her upstairs and put her to bed. Kate is lying in a little sleep-rocker—her favorite spot to sleep during the day. She makes a bit of a coughing noise; we note it but think little of it (babies &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; make that kind of noise). A few minutes later, Jaimie is walking by and glances at Kate. Our baby girl is bright red and turning purple. She grabs her. “Kate! Breathe! Breathe, little girl!” She isn’t breathing; she is getting upset but she isn’t crying. (Babies cry at the drop of a hat.) Little bubbles at her mouth. Jaimie is doing the baby variation of the Heimlich maneuver. I am nearly helpless; I keep using my finger to pull Kate’s mouth open; she finally latches onto the finger, starts sucking, and breathes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold her. She breathes—&lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; normally. We keep paying close attention to her. The couple times I let her lay down on her back she starts seizing up and turning red again within a few minutes until I pick her up and pat her vigorously and she calms down again. We manage to get Ellie in bed. We call the doctor; she sends us to the hospital. A friend comes to watch Ellie and we run out the door. It is a 30-minute drive (and I am speeding, and Jaimie is holding Kate to make sure she keeps breathing).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kate wheezes off and on the whole way there. She still isn’t crying, and she should be. She hasn’t eaten in six hours; she should be hungry. Why isn’t she hungry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit us. They get all her vitals. The doctor is a kind, soft-spoken man with the last name Saad; I like him. He asks dozens of good questions. He tells us, “95–99% of the time, this is just reflux. We just care about that other 1% of the time.” There is no reliable way to stop a baby from choking on milk she spits up because of reflux.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They are going to do an EKG and chest X-rays just to make sure she is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems to be okay. She is eating again—like a champ, like she normally does, like she should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go home to relieve the wonderful friends who are sitting in our house to make sure Ellie is fine. Ellie is still sleeping. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiplash. I am no less excited about that project. And my youngest daughter almost died tonight. Had she started choking while we were upstairs, or while we were all asleep tonight, God only knows what would have happened. We are grateful to God that we were feet away from Kate, that Jaimie “happened” to look at her just then. We are grateful, too, for the extra money coming in; it will help with the so-very-worth-it-but-not-easy-on-a-seminary-budget cost of an emergency room visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to sleep now. Hopefully tomorrow is less extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much so that I am having a hard time spelling “whiplash” correctly. I keep typing “whiplast”.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a police officer stops us, I will explain. He or she will understand. They will help us get to the hospital faster.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrifying, just a bit? Yes.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I always have been. I sat down a few weeks ago to write up an explanation of my running approach, and I haven’t finished it yet… because it is over 2,500 words long and growing rapidly longer. But as I have considered my approach to blogging of late, and as I have also been posting fairly regularly on App.net (my social media locale of choice), it occurred to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts do not have to be the lengthy things I usually make of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often write up a series of thoughts—not necessarily an “argument” or indeed anything more than a series of connected thoughts—on App.net, connecting them via the ‘reply’ mechanism and enumerating them. Rather like I am here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing so inevitably clutters up the streams of anyone following me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That clutter may or may not be problematic: some folks may enjoy those connected thoughts. Others may not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; enjoy those connected thoughts, a blog post like this would probably serve just as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those who do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy them… well, this sort of thing would be a welcome way to clear their streams up without causing me any particular difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using lists does not automatically mean I have given in to the constant temptation to make my blogging about driving views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This blog will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; drive substantial amounts of traffic. That is fine by me. Indeed, I would probably feel a bit odd if it did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, when I have those sorts of thoughts-in-a-line in the future, I will do as I have done here. I will write a ‘listicle’ (the shame!) and share it for others to partake of—or not!—as they please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking that approach will almost certainly free me up to blog more briefly when I feel like it, as well. That, too, can only be a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After all: I am happier when I am writing.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I have so often &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-long-race.html"&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I wish I could identify the pattern.</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Jaimie and I have observed that I tend to go in cycles in my time-spending habits. The issue is not so much whether I spend my time well, but where I spend it. I will go on a blogging kick for a few months, as I did at the beginning of this year, then not write much at all for a few months—but in the interval spend gobs of time reading, or writing software, or so on. I am not sure what it is that triggers the change, but it has been a fairly regular fixture of my life for at least the length of our marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, I will even go on a weeks-long video games or television kick. This is bliss for Jaimie, as she finds spending time together playing video games or watching television shows we both enjoy to be one of our best connecting activities. But then the spell comes to an end, and I’m back off to a reading kick, or designing a new website, or embarking on some crazed software development scheme or another. It somewhat drives Jaimie crazy, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not entirely sure what makes me tick this way. I do know that in those dedicated phases of work I can knock out significant tasks in the given area where I am motivated at any given time. (I have no doubt, for example, that I could pull off the 50,000 words needed for National Novel Writing Month some November, if I were in a writing mode.) Being able to predict these things would be nice, though. I could make a plan for the year and have a good idea what projects I would accomplish. Instead, I find myself extraordinarily productive in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; area at any given time—but never sure what it will be a month later. That’s not a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;. It is, however, a bit perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, I can and do force myself to continue on with certain tasks even when they are not particularly holding my interest. Sometimes that discipline is really helpful, and I eventually break through to another extended session of productivity in the same area. Sometimes, though, the interval—whether it is switching from writing to software and back again, or from software to Doctor Who and back again—brings me back fresher and more energized to complete the tasks. That is no surprise; I see the same patterns play out on the time scale of hours and days with my paid work (where just taking a month off is not particularly workable). Again: I just wish I could get a handle on the timing, so I could take advantage of that in making plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I seem to be in a video games and general blogging mode. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dig back in on my software projects, and I expect I’ll do so soon. And by “soon” I mean: whenever I quit playing more &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;. Probably in about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think I’m going to start tracking the particular moods I am in so that I can see if there is an established pattern throughout the year. Whether it correlates with the season, my other activities, or nothing at all would be helpful to know. For Jaimie’s sanity, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

The last few weeks of class were of course even busier than the rest of the semester, courtesy of a couple major assignments I wrapped up and studying for and taking finals, all while doing my normal work as a software developer on the side. Writing simply fell by the wayside, alas. Even my devotions posts simply didn’t happen. And that is all right; there are seasons for all of these things, and it is not as if I didn’t write many thousands of words in late April and early May. They simply were not &lt;em&gt;blogging&lt;/em&gt; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am tonight, writing simply to unwind. I spent much of the day working on various software projects—a pattern I expect to carry throughout the summer. In addition to my regular work for Quest Consultants Inc. back in Norman, I am picking up various web design and development jobs over the summer. God has been gracious in answering prayers for opportunities to pick up extra contracting work, and I have several really excellent opportunities to supplement my 20 hours a week for Quest with other work. That is nice not only financially, but also intellectually. The change of pace between different kinds of work helps me stay fresh on all of them. My own personal &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-little-crazy.html"&gt;side projects&lt;/a&gt; are coming along slowly, but that is all right. Slow but steady is the best way to go about those kinds of projects anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lesson is one I have learned more and more from my ongoing and ever-increasing delight in running. So far in May I have run about 125 miles; I expect to run over 150 miles this month in total (though of course all such plans are always subject to revision, and never more so than when one’s wife is 37 weeks pregnant). I am now running easy, aerobic miles ten to fifteen seconds faster per mile than I could manage in my personal best half marathon time a few years ago. I run so (relatively) quickly now not because of any particular innate athleticism—quite the contrary, as anyone who has known me since high school can attest. I can run as far and fast as I do only because I have stuck with it and used a &lt;a href="http://markallenonline.com/maoArticles.aspx?AID=2" title="Working Your Heart"&gt;smart training plan&lt;/a&gt;. And really, as in most parts of life, it is that sticking-with-it that leads to getting somewhere. Of course, sticking with it is no guarantee that things will work out. It is usually a requisite step along the way, though—a necessary-though-insufficient condition. That is simply the way God built the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Ellie is quickly wrapping up her second year of life in this big world. She is saying lots of words (at last!), whining until she has driven Jaimie a bit crazy (in too-typical toddler fashion), and growing up in big ways and small. We are having a great deal of fun watching her start to be more socially aware and active, even if it is a little strange to have a daughter old enough that she has friends whom she loves and who love her in turn. She has also discovered a deep love of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;—no surprise for a daughter of ours, though the intensity of her delight in the movies, for a girl who is not yet two years old, did surprise both Jaimie and me a bit. You should hear her try to say “Darth Vader” or “Dark Side” or “Star Wars.” It is impossibly adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaimie is, as noted above, some 37 weeks pregnant and quite ready to be done carrying our second little gal on the inside. She is still plugging away slowly at the &lt;a href="http://jaimiekrycho.com/shaking-epheria-pt-1/" title="Bloodlines: The Shaking of Epheria, Part I"&gt;second novella&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bloodlines-Epheria-The-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00HY478QO/" title="Get Bloodlines of Epheria on Kindle!"&gt;Bloodlines&lt;/a&gt; fantasy trilogy. She manages to keep Ellie entertained—no small feat—and does a remarkable job taking care of things around the house so that I can focus on work and school. Her struggle with &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/marriage-depression/" title="Marriage and Depression"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; has not diminished, but God has given us grace to carry on and she and I have both learned to respond in better, healthier, more helpful ways when the slumps come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future, we really have no idea what the next several yeras will hold. I plan to finish my Master of Divinity—Lord willing, around December 2016. In the meantime, we will keep raising our little girls, I will keep writing software, and we will keep exploring and seeing what we want to do and how best to pursue those desires in a way that honors God. Who knows what those years will hold? God only, and certainly not us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I was cleaning up the dishes and playing Max Richter’s &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/memoryhouse/id545010150"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memoryhouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; album, I saw Ellie dancing, and encouraged her to keep going. After a moment, I looked over to see her spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. And spinning in circles. When she finally stopped, she started freaking out as she couldn’t get her balance. I swooped in and picked her up, laughing with her once she recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After she calmed down, she started tugging on my shirt. It took me a few seconds to realize what she wanted, but then it clicked: she was trying to turn me by twisting my shirt. “You want to spin?” I asked her. She nodded vigorously. “Is this a spinning song?” Again, the vigorous nod. So I started spinning around and around with her in my arms, and the sheer joy in the grin plastered across her face was something to behold. We spun first one way, then the other, all the way through &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfoSv8iWA_I"&gt;“The Twins (Prague)”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments like these are worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;

This was disappointing: I have enjoyed the habit of writing regularly, and I intend to keep it up. As I have often noted in the past (in more blog posts on previous versions of the site than I can count, still less dig up at the moment), writing serves to focus my thoughts as little else does. Moreover, though my &lt;a href="/devotions"&gt;#devotions&lt;/a&gt; posts are not especially excellent as writing goes, the discipline of writing is like many other things: sometimes it matters most that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it more than the doing of it be particularly magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my running is this way. The vast majority of my runs are entirely unexceptional and become notable only in their consistency. They are not tiring and not particularly fast—for me, at least! This is an important qualification, I recognize, though one that is nonetheless closely tied to the very ordinary nature of these runs. They become interesting, and are effective, only in the aggregate. My entire training plan is built on going slowly and training the “easy” side of my physiological response to running. The effect over time is extraordinary, though: my easy runs with a toddler in a stroller today are faster than my best runs alone were a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope for this year is to do something the same with my writing. I do not expect that the majority of my words will be particularly elegant or well-put-together. I expect most of my posts to go largely unread and unnoticed, and that is perfectly fine with me—indeed, &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than fine, because I am writing them first of all as a double act of self-discipline. From those devotional posts I hope to gain not an audience but the benefit of thoughtful reflection the Scriptures I read and the helpful effect of regular writing on my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when, as in the last few days, I simply cannot get to that writing because other things intrude, I have a double response. First, I recognize that this is totally all right, under the circumstances. Jaimie and I have been spending time with friends and each other, and my normal writing times in the evenings have simply been elided by those other activities. Second, though, I recognize that such things are likely to come up often, and as such am motivated to commit once again to doing this writing in the mornings as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks in the beginning of the semester this spring, I was able to get up, do my reading, and do my writing before I went to class at 8am. A few weeks ago, Jaimie’s grandmother passed away and we flew her out for the funeral, and that weekend completely tossed my habits and schedule out of alignment. Instead of my two normally scheduled tasks for the weekend (school and work), I had three—and one of them in the form of a teething toddler. The other two slipped. I have only just finally caught up, and as such I am hoping that in the week ahead I shall be able to resume my previously very effective habits of doing all these things to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the day rather than to finish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, assumes I get over this blasted cold that I seem to have caught last night… Life is a funny thing, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
