I have a bunch of mostly-unformed thoughts, and I want to write, and the two come out here, together, in the next few minutes before I start my workday proper (because I stayed up late last night working on open source software and got up late accordingly, and so have a great deal less of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="“Knowing Your Rhythms”"&gt;my normally-allocated writing time&lt;/a&gt; available today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a very strange place, and the dynamics of it favor those of us who already have well-paying jobs and lots of flexibility in our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing. It means that anyone who wants to use open-source contribution as a gauge of someone’s fitness to work is making a pretty foolish decision, though: they’re inherently cutting off a whole sector—dare I say it, a whole &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;—of people who simply do not (and, barring being given a pretty surprising break, will never) have that kind of stability and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad for meaningful discussion. I follow both &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/noahpinion"&gt;Noah Smith (@noahpinion)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky"&gt;Lyman Stone (@lymanstoneky)&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re both extremely interesting follows, and they’re both clearly &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; smart and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well-informed, and in their off-Twitter writing they both do a good job of fairly representing others’ views and interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, their arguments are a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specific to Smith and Stone. This is Twitter in one pair of interlocutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously: stop tweeting and start blogging again, if you have an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; to make rather than just a pithy, one-off observation or a link to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a surprising amount of writing done in 5 minutes, if you’re willing to just word-vomit. (This whole post, start to finish, took me 12 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more poetry; more rich, good fiction; more rich, good nonfiction. I’ve read a lot of nonfiction in the last five years, but I wouldn’t call most of it &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;. Most of it—most of my seminary reading, that is—was &lt;em&gt;just okay&lt;/em&gt;; very little of it engaged deeply with thought critical of its own perspective. (Major exceptions: David Koyzis’ really excellent_Political Visions and Illusions_, Alvin Plantinga’s_Where the Conflict Really Lies_, and of course St. Athanasius’ &lt;em&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find that my own writing is far sharper, clearer, and better when I’m drawing &lt;em&gt;widely&lt;/em&gt; and from &lt;em&gt;deep wells&lt;/em&gt;. Widely, because I find that too much time in the same spot overly narrows my focus, whether that is apologetics or programming languages. From deep wells because, frankly, there is too much out there which warrants nothing more than a skim &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

But over the last few years I’ve been thinking about, and I’m increasingly concerned about, the ways that we are shaped by our use of technology. We could generalize this discussion to all sorts of things, and I’m sure I will (though I’m also pretty sure you’d just be better off reading &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com" title="The Frailest Thing"&gt;L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;, whom I’ve linked in this connection before). But for today, I want to just zoom in and think about this question specifically in the context of technologies we employ in the context of the Christian faith. (If you’re not a Christian, I suspect much of what I have to say here will still ring true, so don’t run off just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using apps to manage my list of tasks to get through for a long time: first &lt;a href="https://todoist.com"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;. So as I’ve been wanting to develop more rigor around my prayer life, and in particular to make sure I pray for certain people and the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult circumstances they’re currently facing, it was natural to go looking for an app to manage that. And although “There’s an app for that” is no longer an Apple marketing campaign, is truer than ever it was when it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an Apple marketing campaign. So there are a lot of prayer apps on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I snagged an app both my wife and another woman I really respect have found helpful as a tool for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; prayer lives. And it’s been sitting there unused for a month. I launched the app once. I’ve had an item in Things for that whole time to populate it. But I haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole time the app has been sitting there on my homescreen, I’ve been stuck on this question: &lt;em&gt;How does this tool form me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the broader question that’s nagged at me for quite some time. How are we shaped and formed by our use of, and indeed our &lt;em&gt;dependence on&lt;/em&gt;, the tools we employ to remember things, to form habits, etc.? What happens if the tool goes away? Nick Carr has written fairly extensively&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the effects on concentration and memory; but those merely point to a broader concern: what kind of people do we wish to form ourselves to be? And are our tools helping or hurting us in that aim? For our tools &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; form us, no less than we form them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not really about this (or any particular) prayer app. And I certainly don’t think it’s &lt;em&gt;inherently wrong&lt;/em&gt; to use a prayer app, or anything of the sort. But it nags at me. Will I truly learn to be disciplined about prayer, or will I simply learn to be further hooked on alerts from my pocket supercomputer? If I end up praying faithfully for people, but also end up more distracted, more reliant on this little slab of metal and glass, less engaged with my family, what is the net on that? It is, at a minimum, not a clear &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of these concerns are specific to prayer apps. I have been using a digital Bible for most of a decade now. I use a pomodoro timer to help my maintain my discipline and concentration throughout my work. I use &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; for keeping a log of what I’ve done for work every day,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and for jotting down writing ideas. This very post started out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/bear-blog-idea.png" title="Bear app" alt="The note in Bear that was the germination of this blog post" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The note in Bear that was the germination of this blog post&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a digital notes app is not the same as disciplining myself to remember things. But the same concerns apply, of course, to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; aids we employ. Using a digital notes app is not identical to using a physical notebook as a place for jotting down ideas—but they’re more similar to each other than they are to &lt;em&gt;not using a tool at all&lt;/em&gt;. Both have a cost in effective, &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; memory of those ideas. On the other hand, they also have the benefit of helping us remember more ideas, and more clearly, than we would otherwise, and also of freeing us to think on and remember &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also points to another of the fundamental challenges in evaluating the tools we use. We’re accustomed to thinking of many things—these days, mostly computers and computerized things—as technological and other things as sort of “natural” and “untechnological.” But of course, literally everything we do is unnatural and technological in many ways—too many to count; but for a start consider that clothing is not &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt;; it is a technology! So are books. So are forks and cups and plates. So are journals, and pencils, and pens. And those technologies all shape and form us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribbling notes in a paper journal day after day will change your body and your mind; you will have calluses from holding the pen, and will know that your ideas are found in that journal. The loss of a journal filled with sketches of ideas might become a horrifying thought, because in writing down one’s ideas, one intentionally lets the paper do the work that one’s memory might have done otherwise. &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; of those things—though by no means all—are just the same whether using a digital journal or a paper one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in my own experience, some of the important differences include the way it feels mentally to think with a pen vs. to think with a keyboard. (I use the phrase “think with” here to emphasize what it is we’re doing either way: using the tool to help us think as well as to remember.) That difference is, so far as I can tell in considering my own thinking, not just one of &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, either: I write different things, in different ways, with pen and paper than I do with a keyboard. I’m a much better poet with pen and paper, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those differences do not void the core they share: they are memory-replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for nothing have people worried about the effects of new technologies on memory for millennia. And it is worth note: those who thought the advent of each kind of new information technology would come with costs were not wrong. Literate cultures seem inevitably to lose the power of oral recall. Members of illiterate cultures can often accomplish feats of memory that astound members of literate cultures, because they do not have books to offload their stories and histories to. The only way to keep them—and we value stories, so we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; find a way to keep them—is to commit them to memory, and deeply. The tradeoff with books is real. The tradeoff with a physical journal is real. The tradeoff with the internet is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we will be formed by the technologies we employ—at least, unless you plan to go back to living naked, surviving off of whatever you can manage to collect with your bare hands and eat raw (fire, too, is technology, after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To narrow it further: the question is which specific shapings we find needful in our specific contexts. Perhaps, if there is a problem, it is not with a prayer app individually, or a todo app individually, or a notes app individually, but with offloading &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our mental tasks to a smartphone. No harm done in using a prayer app; but maybe write your to-do list on paper; and perhaps find something, anything at all, to simply &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; to do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

Blog more.</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/tweet-less-blog-more.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho/status/947607650484740098"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested 2018 resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚡️ Tweet less. Blog more. ⚡️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll make all of our discourse better and richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m going to trace out how I plan to do that, in hopes that it’ll help others write (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/947694285004201984"&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt;!) more blog posts—short posts, long posts, and everything in between. In another post (probably tomorrow or Thursday), I’ll explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I think this is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweet less.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re tempted to string together more than two or &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt; three tweets… you have a blog post. Seriously! At 280 characters, if you assume a word is roughly 5 characters on average, and toss in spaces and punctuation, you’ve got 40–45 words in a tweet. Three of those is 120–130 words. Five tweets is 200–225 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down your ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a &lt;code&gt;#writing/ideas&lt;/code&gt; tag in &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8" title="Bear by Shiny Frog on the App Store"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and new ideas I have just get thrown in there. When I have a day where I don’t have some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; specific idea to tackle, I browse through that list and grab something that seems interesting. As an example: my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html"&gt;“Chrome is Not the Standard”&lt;/a&gt; post had just been sitting in there for a couple months when I finally got around to writing it up a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay with being brief.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a wordy guy, but I think many people feel the need to write &lt;em&gt;much longer&lt;/em&gt; material now than they did in the early days of blogging, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; Twitter exists. It’s as if the existence of a microblogging platform makes us feel like a 200-word post doesn’t justify its own existence. I don’t believe that: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html" title="Momentum"&gt;I write short posts sometimes!&lt;/a&gt; And some of &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/"&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/many-ways-learn/"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; regularly do likewise.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay taking a while to finish.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes a piece can take a few weeks (or months!) to gel. That’s okay. Keep at it. Take some of your allocated writing time and keep plugging. That’s how I finally finished &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="“Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins”"&gt;this book review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But finish things.&lt;/strong&gt; That means: get them to a spot where you’re ready to post them (even if they’re not perfect [because they never are!]) or eventually just throw them away. Both are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block out some time for it!&lt;/strong&gt; The main reason for my flurry of posts of late is that &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms"&gt;I started writing every day before 7am&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a habit I’m keeping! It helps. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; scripts. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/four-languages/"&gt;technical writing&lt;/a&gt;. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/star-wars-the-internet-and-me.html" title="Star Wars, the Internet, and Me"&gt;reflections on _Star Wars_&lt;/a&gt;. But blocking out the time means &lt;em&gt;writing will happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I’m breaking these down into three big categories this year, having learned from the experience of summarizing my goals for last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing aims&lt;/strong&gt;: things that I can’t exactly check off as &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, but which are extremely important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;: things I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; mark as done.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary:&lt;/strong&gt; the most important of my goals—the ones I’ll count myself as having failed in some way if I don’t accomplish them over the course of the year (barring &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; unforeseen goings-on, which are, well… impossible to foresee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;: other goals, which I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to get to, but which it won’t bother me if I don’t get to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section id="standing-aims" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standing aims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate well into our new church—including finding specific ways and places to serve regularly, joining a small group, and making some good friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more, better, and more consistent time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="primary" class="level3"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read, or finish reading, the following books:

&lt;li&gt;Lead a book club at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up to 20 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print hard copies of at least one year of my website archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; to go after this year. One thing that isn’t apparent here is that a fair bit of this is aimed at goals that extend past this year. There are things I want to do in the first half of my thirties if possible, of which some of these are a part. I don’t have those kinds of things written down (and when I write them down, I probably won’t publish them here!) but as I come into the broad swath of life that is just “adulthood”—not &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; adulthood or &lt;em&gt;old age&lt;/em&gt;—I am increasingly mindful of the kinds of things I want to do that take more than a single year to accomplish. Some of these move the needle substantially in that direction, so hopefully I’ll get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Thinking about how this year went and what I accomplished, and how I would like the next year to go and what I would like to accomplish &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, has become an important part of my life. There is value in taking stock and making plans—as long as you hold those plans loosely. And this particular set of reflections majors on holding plans loosely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start seems to be with a review of my goals for 2017, set out &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html" title="2016 in Review, Part 6: Plans for 2017"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In a post later this week, I’ll write up some thoughts on what I hope to accomplish in 2018—though, as you’ll see, there are some hints of that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note: there are many things going on in our lives that don’t end up in these reflections—because these reflections (as I conceive them at present, at least) are about the kind of public-facing things I did this year. A blog is not a journal, even if there are some analogies between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="major-goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really a thing you can ever call &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; in a real sense; there’s always more to do. But we did it well this year, and better than any previous year. I’m looking forward to building on the foundation we laid this year as we move into 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have much the same to say here as I do about family time. I’ll add that we did move across country and join a new church (and a new denomination!), and I expect to write at much greater length about the convictions which drove the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; we landed on our new congregation after moving across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="4" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shipped a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of code this year, including making some pretty significant architectural contributions for the main app I work on—laying the foundation for it to transition from being a &lt;em&gt;mobile&lt;/em&gt; web application to being a &lt;em&gt;responsive, progressive&lt;/em&gt; web application in 2018. I also built &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt; and made some pretty substantial progress on &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/" title="Typing Your Ember"&gt;TypeScript in Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="5" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt; And, to our surprise relative to the beginning of the year, we’re moving in less than a month from now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="6" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I basically ended up putting Lightning on hold entirely this year. New Rustacean and all of the things we had to do around moving just left me with insufficient time to make any sustained progress on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="minor-goals" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minor goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average… done.&lt;/strong&gt; But only on average. I put out a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more episodes in November and December than any other month, courtesy of the &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/interview/rbr_2017/index.html"&gt;micro-interviews&lt;/a&gt; I conducted at &lt;a href="https://rust-belt-rust.com"&gt;Rust Belt Rust&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the year, I did publish quite a few episodes, but not nearly as many as I would have liked – more like an average of 1–1.5 each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/strong&gt; Winning Slowly did not go &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; the way we thought this year. Our ambitions were… ambitious, given we were both planning to finish graduate degrees and knew that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; Stephen and possibly &lt;em&gt;both of us&lt;/em&gt; would be moving across the country. Total episodes published this year: 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com" title="City of Oaks Marathon"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; The spring ended up busier and, most importantly, more unpredictable schedule-wise than I hoped, and than allowed for sufficiently regular exercise as to be ready for a triathlon in the summer. And our move across the country both eliminated the final six weeks of training I would have needed for the marathon, and also left us 1,800 miles away from the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not sure!&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t done a max set in a few months. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been doing a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups since arriving in Colorado, so… maybe. I’ll edit this in a couple days after I do a max set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadly, not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I have not yet gotten a good handle on what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; dietary changes I’ll need to make to accomplish this goal, but the ones I tried this year didn’t do the trick. I’ll try something new in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done:&lt;/strong&gt; I made a fair bit of progress at the beginning of the year, but this is a &lt;em&gt;mammoth&lt;/em&gt; task. That said, it’s on my radar to try to help drive it forward (hopefully with community involvement) in 2018—it would be great for a complete and accurate reference to be part of the Rust 2019 epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, I fixed the last couple bugs and tightened things down in the implementation of &lt;a href="https://holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;. While there’s a lot—oh is there a lot!—I would do differently now (3 years after I finished the base implementation of the app), I’m really delighted that in the last six months I’ve had exactly zero bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt; this was an intentional choice as we started into the year, because there were a couple other guys who it was more helpful to have in that role for their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; training. I’ve taught a lot over the years, and both of those guys are going to be actively in church-planting roles in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; I published &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/rhythms-family-worship/" title="The Rhythms of Family Worship"&gt;one essay on our family worship&lt;/a&gt; and another (just last week), &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins"&gt;a book review essay&lt;/a&gt; on William T. Cavanaugh and James K. A. Smith’s _Evolution and the Fall_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; expect to tackle this in 2018, but it just ended up not being a high priority in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; Same as with the New Rustacean ebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started, but incomplete.&lt;/strong&gt; I pulled those archives down for the Blogger site, but have yet to do some systematic cleanup on the &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;. (This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; actually happen by the end of the year, depending on what all I do on my week off, but as of the time I’m drafting this, it’s not done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I did get a Linode server configured, on which I’m running our family blog (&lt;a href="https://krycho.com"&gt;krycho.com&lt;/a&gt;), and which I should pretty easily be able to use for other non-static sites going forward. Though, as I’ve thought about it over the last year and change: it’s likely I’ll split it up into a small handful, with one consisting of a kind of “shared hosting” for the various friends’ WordPress blogs I host; and one consisting of my own and my family’s sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="in-summary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year didn’t really go as we thought it would. A lot of that came down to finding a house plan we loved and could build on a lot that we equally loved—it shifted financial and temporal priorities alike. Add in some pretty serious family health issues in my extended family, and, well, no surprise some of my plans and goals didn’t pan out. That’s how it goes! The point of making these kinds of goals, for me, isn’t so much that I accomplish everything on my list as it is taking time to orient myself and to choose what I will and won’t &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; on in the year ahead. And in 2017, I did focus on many of the things on this list. Some of them ended up more important than expected; others less. Interestingly and importantly, though, almost nothing I really spent my time focusing on &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; on the list. And that’s why I keep doing this year after year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

In that time, I’ve managed to (finally!) publish a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins: Cavanaugh and Smith’s Evolution and the Fall"&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; I had been planning to tackle (and had abortively started more than once) for months; I have written almost as many words as I have the whole rest of the year; and I published &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html" title="Chrome is not the Standard"&gt;one post&lt;/a&gt; that apparently &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15980653"&gt;struck a nerve&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that has become obvious is that &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;my initial surmise&lt;/a&gt; was correct: the early morning &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best time for me to be writing, and I get a lot of mileage out of taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little post is a reflection not just on that upside, though, but on rolling with the punches. It’s now 7:30pm, and I didn’t write at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; this morning… because I didn’t sleep much last night. My little sister and her husband are in town with their 7-year-old and 3-week-old… and the 3-week-old, one room over from us, slept about the way 3-week-old babies tend to. Add in a 3:45am call from my wife and kids who had to &lt;a href="http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Fire-forces-evacuation-at-Dallas-Love-Field-465891633.html"&gt;evacuate the airport for a fire alarm&lt;/a&gt; where they were trying to fly home from visiting family, and the need then to drive up to the airport to get them, and my normal writing block simply didn’t exist. So here I am some 13 hours later, trying to just write a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit today anyway, because even after just these couple weeks I have come to value getting out some words every day. After I finish this little post, I’ll see if I can knock out another section of the New Rustacean episode I’m drafting for early January, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity” often looks like this: just a bit at a time, day after day; and doing a little even when you don’t really feel like it, just so you keep some forward motion going. Here’s to a lot of keeping-up-that-momentum in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 19:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2017-12-22:/2017/momentum.html</guid><category>productivity</category><category>writing</category></item><item><title>A Little Status Update</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/a-little-status-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a little status update: I’m a few days into &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;my new routine&lt;/a&gt; of blocking out the time before 7am for writing projects—and so far it’s &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve been able to make progress on a writing project&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has stymied me for months and months. Yesterday and today alike I wrote 600–700 words in roughly an hour (and words I’m relatively happy with, at that). All my previous efforts at this had come to about 600 words in total, largely in outline form, and when I’d taken a stab at it other than that I’d eventually given up and thrown away anything I’d written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pleasant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;Knowing your rhythms&lt;/a&gt; is useful, it turns out; even more useful is taking advantage of them to actually get things done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I’m noticing (as I write at about 6:45pm, in one of those “just okay” spans I mentioned in that post) is that my mind is ticking along again in what I’ve historically called “writing mode.” The idea of sitting down and knocking out a few hundred words of (admittedly self-indulgent) blogging has not seemed relaxing or fun in quite some time. But that’s changing a bit as I stretch those muscles again. I’ve drawn the analogy often enough in the past, but I’ll repeat it once more: writing is very much like exercising. The act of simply &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; it day over day helps reopen pathways in the mind (like running down paths in the woods, perhaps?) and every day you do it makes the next day easier than it otherwise would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now: off to work on a New Rustacean episode script, because the juices are flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;a review of William Cavanaugh and James K. A. Smith’s &lt;em&gt;Evolution and the Fall&lt;/em&gt;, if you’re curious&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 18:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2017-12-13:/2017/a-little-status-update.html</guid><category>writing</category><category>productivity</category></item><item><title>Why Do I Need A Research Tool?</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/why-do-i-need-a-research-tool.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For a bit of follow-up on &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/how-do-you-manage-your-research-notes.html" title="How Do You Manage Your Research Notes"&gt;this morning’s post&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It struck me that there’s a really important thing implicit in the whole question that’s perhaps worth making explicit. That is: &lt;em&gt;it’s worth doing the work of capturing what you’re reading&lt;/em&gt;, at least when it’s relevant to something you’re &lt;em&gt;studying&lt;/em&gt;. This isn’t necessarily obvious, and especially if you have a good memory, you can often get by in shorter-form writing and day-to-day conversation by relying on your memory. It’ll get you &lt;em&gt;close enough&lt;/em&gt; that you can say, “Oh, so-and-so says this,” or even fall back to “I wish I could remember where I read this…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you want to do something a bit more substantive—say, a medium-length essay, or a detailed book review, much less a long-form essay or academic paper or (good grief!) a book—well, then you need a way of actually keeping track of what you’ve read and where you read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early reading phases for a research project I’d like to tackle over the next year (and possibly much longer): namely, developing at least for myself a more coherent &lt;em&gt;ethics of technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And one thing I learned in one of my largest projects at Southeastern Seminary (a summary of a variety of theological systems as represented by reading thousands of pages of introductions to them and writing about 80,000 words of summary of those pages) was the importance of taking careful notes on what I read and then being able to reference and make use of those notes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that project also left me deeply, deeply frustrated, because nothing I tried actually satisfied me as a way of taking notes in a way I could reference later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing quotes out by hand is laborious, and it doubles the work you have to do with that reference when you need to incorporate it into a paper or essay later: you’re often enough going to end up typing it out either way. But on the other hand, writing down a quote inscribes something into your mind in a way that tapping on a keyboard doesn’t. (This is part of why I outline every talk, teaching session, and sermon I deliver by hand!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while I’ve developed a system for marking up books in a way that’s reasonably unobtrusive but is easy to understand,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; that markup in the text of a book has its own issues. I’ve resorted to dog-earing pages with the most important quotes and ideas in the past, but found this dissatisfying. I know some people use colored page markers, and I need to try that as an approach (though it offends my aesthetic sensibilities as much or more than dog-earing in its own way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the inciting incident for this blog post: I was thinking as I read &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/12/it-might-be-impossible-for-future-historians-to-understand-our-internet/547463/" title="&amp;quot;Future Historians Probably Won&amp;#39;t Understand Our Internet, and That&amp;#39;s Okay&amp;quot;"&gt;a helpful article by Alexis Madrigal at the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and then saved it to pinboard that it’s a lot of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to do this kind of thing. But if you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do it, you’re floundering around and hoping that your memory or &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; or the combination of the two will get you back to where you need to be for some or another bit of research you’re doing… and good luck with that. In my experience, the more I’ve read on a topic, the harder it can be to remember &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; where I read a particularly important idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I’m curious about people’s research tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this as my following some of the same kinds of paths being worn down right now by writers and thinkers like &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org"&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/the-frailest-thing/"&gt;L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s certainly not &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; as a line of thinking for me—see a related post &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/theological-anthropology.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use brackets to mark off important quotes, the same way someone might use a highlighter, because I hate highlighted books myself. I’ll underline &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; important bits. I jot comments notes in the margins. I mark places where I disagree sufficiently strongly with an “x” and where I agree sufficiently strongly with a check mark or an exclamation point. Things that are essential items in the argument of the book—i.e. things which articulate or are central to argument for the thesis of the book—I’ll mark in the margins with a star. Nothing complicated!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Scribbling things in journals is one good approach (though it can be hard to find things later), and organization is something of a problem—I’ve considered a notebook-per-subject approach, but the problem is that my interests are cross-disciplinary; and in any case, for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, research often includes the unexpected insight from an apparently unrelated field. So segregating things off that way seems like the kind of thing that would ultimately still just end up frustrating me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using tools like &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:chriskrycho/" title="my Pinboard"&gt;pinboard&lt;/a&gt; is another approach. It’s a particularly valuable one for digital articles and the like, and it has the tag-like architecture I’ve come to think is most appropriate for organizing this kind of content. However, I haven’t yet upgraded to the full article archive mode it offers, and search-ability remains something of a bugbear for me as a result. (My lasting problem remains remembering &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; I read something specific.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And bringing all the pieces together—notes scribbled in the margins of books and highlights or underlines in the same; thoughts jotted out at length in a paper journal; pinboard links; half-finished blog posts which helped me formulate ideas even if they never went anywhere—is its own task I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; handle on. Four and a half years of graduate education &lt;em&gt;exacerbated&lt;/em&gt; the problem rather than suggesting solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m curious to hear, especially from working scholars and writers out there—into whose company I’d like to slowly grow myself in the years ahead—how in the world do you manage your research notes?&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 10:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2017-12-10:/2017/how-do-you-manage-your-research-notes.html</guid><category>writing</category></item><item><title>The Value of Silence</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/the-value-of-silence.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so, I’ve increasingly become persuaded of the importance of times of silence for clear thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve spent the last several years listening to podcasts in much of my walking and running time, I’ve started blocking out times in which I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; listening to things that way—times dedicated either to just instrumental music, or simply to silence. This goes for more than those walks and runs. I’ve also been thinking about driving time, which I likewise once filled with thought, but which in recent years I have, again, filled with podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my runs in silence. I often drove in silence or with only instrumental music. I moved away from that somewhat in my years in North Carolina, in part because I discovered a great many podcasts I enjoyed, and in part because it was a way of sustaining mental focus when I had run the same routes too many times. Soon, it bled into my pomodoro walks and into nearly all my drives as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But much of my best thinking happened in those silences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need that space for letting my mind tease out questions and issues I’m thinking on. So: while not eliminating podcasts, I have been intentionally carving out more and more time again for silence. Pomodoro walks, runs, drives. Times when I simply listen to interesting music and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for silence goes beyond merely podcasts for me. I’ve continued to think about the role of Twitter in my life, the amount of time I spend looking at RSS feeds, and even my enjoyment of times in e.g. Slack communities I participate in. Twitter I have long limited strictly—it’s &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org/joe-posnanski-wises-up/"&gt;an enormous and often unproductive time sink&lt;/a&gt;—but even RSS (which is much better for thought in nearly every way!) and healthy Slack communities can be &lt;em&gt;connecting&lt;/em&gt; in ways that actually &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:ayjay/b:c7d2be58b366"&gt;inhibit deep thought&lt;/a&gt;. We need a degree of solitude and silence to think well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, though each of those is often a good source of information, and I enjoy them, I am increasingly aware of the curious ways they interact with my ability to think clearly and deeply about things. And about the ways they shift the &lt;em&gt;arena&lt;/em&gt; of my thinking clearly and deeply about things. Pose me a question and I’m apt to answer it, but the way I answer it in a Slack chat is different from—and often worse than—the way I’d answer it if I took the time to write it up as a blog post, and that in turn different from how I would approach it if composing a medium-length essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am sussing out where and how I want to draw those lines, where I want to &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2017/11/18/the-ethics-of-technological-mediation/"&gt;pay my attention&lt;/a&gt;, because &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-for-disputation/"&gt;attention is indeed something we pay&lt;/a&gt;. Fewer podcasts, less time in ephemeral media (even including blogging); more time in books and long essays and in writing itself as a means of coming to understanding. More time, indeed, scribbling notes in paper notebooks, for the ways that time spent thinking &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; disconnected from the internet shapes us. More time, when I’m writing in a digital form, with the wifi off. And hopefully, as a result, more and better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended With Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt; This book is just okay, and at this point it’s a bit outdated—but if you’re in its fairly narrow target audience, it’s a decent way to get up to speed on F#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of F♯: Breaking Free With Managed Functional Programming&lt;/em&gt; is a No Starch Press publication by Dave Fancher, published in 2014. I read it over the course of the last four or so months, just plugging away in my spare cycles. A couple qualifications on the short list of observations that follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any experience whatsoever writing production F♯ (though I have &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; a fair bit of it). I am interested because it’s a functional programming language on the .NET stack—which isn’t my own personal favorite stack, but &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the stack at Olo. If we’re going to ship functional code on the server, it’ll be in F♯.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also not a C♯ developer. As such, I’m &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; not the audience of this book. As Fancher put it in the intro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book for people like me: experienced .NET developers looking to break into functional programming while retaining the safety net of the tools and libraries they’re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net of that is that a lot of what frustrated me about the book is just a result of my not being the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those qualifications aside, some assorted thoughts on the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as the intro and my above qualification suggest: this is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not interesting or useful as a general introduction to F♯. Throughout, it assumes a very high baseline of C♯ knowledge. In fact, the majority of the discussion of F♯, even in the section of the book which turns away from object oriented programming toward functional programming, focuses on comparing F♯ to C♯. This makes sense for the target audience, but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the book for you if you’re not a C♯ developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a C♯ developer, this could be a useful resource as you’re spinning up. It also might be a useful book to work through with a group of C♯ developers who want to learn F♯. The comparisons &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; generally work in F♯’s favor, even when doing exactly what you would be doing in the C♯, which makes it an easier “sell” in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, the book is structured as a &lt;em&gt;very gradual&lt;/em&gt; introduction to functional programming ideas. Roughly the first half of the book emphasizes F♯’s object-oriented programming abilities, and only in the second half does Fancher turn to a functional style. Again, this is probably the right move given the audience, but it means the book spends a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time on kinds of F♯ you won’t actually be writing very often once you’re going. Idiomatic F♯ isn’t object-oriented. But as a way of helping someone make the transition, it’s not a bad plan: object-oriented F♯ is briefer and nicer in many ways than the exact same code in C♯. It meant that the first half of the book was completely uninteresting to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, though: I don’t want to write a line of object-oriented F♯.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this had a pretty serious downside even for existing C♯ developers, though: the book often ends up seeming like it’s sort of apologizing for or defending F♯ against an expected audience of people asking “What’s wrong with C♯?” And even though there’s a real sense in which that’s true—that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what a lot of the audience is asking, no doubt—it became quite annoying rhetorically.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It’s also unnecessary: if someone is picking up a book on F♯, you can assume that they’re alredy at least a little interested in the language and what it might offer! Along those lines, I much prefer the tack taken in what I’ve seen of Scott Wlaschin’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F♯&lt;/em&gt; (The Pragmatic Bookshelf, expected in fall 2017)—which shows not how to do the same things as in C♯, just more briefly; but how to solve the same problems much more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those problems aside, the book was… &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. I wouldn’t call it scintillating reading, but this kind of technical writing, especially at this length, is really hard work. Credit to Fancher for managing an introduction to an entire programming language in a relatively approachable way, and credit to him and his editors for making sure it remains lucid throughout. Still: I’d love to see the bar for programming books be higher. We need more books which are genuinely engaging in the world of programming language texts. These things are &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;; we don’t have to make them dry and dull! (And if you want a pretty good example of that: everything I’ve read of Edwin Brady’s &lt;em&gt;Type-Driven Development with Idris&lt;/em&gt; hits the mark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other observations about the language itself from reading the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First,&lt;/strong&gt; reading this highlighted a lot of strange things about F♯, all of which ultimately come down to the ways F♯’s development has been driven by concerns for interoperability with C♯. Worse, there are a lot of places where the influence of C♯ casts this shadow &lt;em&gt;entirely unnecessarily&lt;/em&gt;. One particular expression of this which drove me crazy: F♯ far too often uses exceptions instead of &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt;s. It’s &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/better-off-using-exceptions.html"&gt;one thing&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the language gracefully handle exceptions: you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have them coming from outside contexts. It is another entirely to design core parts of the language to throw exceptions where it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most prominent example is the &lt;code&gt;List.head&lt;/code&gt; function. Its type signature is &lt;code&gt;'T list -&amp;gt; 'T&lt;/code&gt;, where I would expect it to be &lt;code&gt;'T list -&amp;gt; 'T option&lt;/code&gt;. If you call &lt;code&gt;List.head&lt;/code&gt; on an empty list, you get an exception. It would make far more sense for it to return an &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; and just give you &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if there’s no item. Then you’re not worried about &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; expressions and the type system will actually help you! This is one of the most valuable parts of having a type system like F♯’s! I really don’t understand a lot of these decisions, not least since this isn’t for interop with C♯ collections—these are for native F♯ collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second,&lt;/strong&gt; the use of things like computation expressions instead of type machinery has an interesting effect: it makes it simpler to read when you first encounter it, but harder to compose, build, etc.—and it’s more syntax to remember. Computation expressions just end up being a way to do “monadic” transformations, from what I can tell. But as I noted often in my discussion of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt;, I profoundly prefer approaches that build on the same existing machinery—even in the surface syntax of the language—rather than constantly building new machinery. It makes it easier to deeply internalize new concepts and to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the language (rather than just being able to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;) the language. It also seems (from my admittedly limited vantage point) that computation expressions are as a result much less &lt;em&gt;composable&lt;/em&gt; than actual type machinery of the sort available in other languages (Haskell, Idris, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the tradeoff there is that adding those adds a lot of complexity both to the compiler and to the libraries people are apt to write; there’s a reason Elm has totally eschewed that kind of type machinery to date. But Elm has also refused to just add syntax around ideas like this the way F♯ has here, and it makes for a much cleaner and frankly &lt;em&gt;nicer&lt;/em&gt; language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings me to my &lt;strong&gt;third and final&lt;/strong&gt; point: I’m really glad F♯ exists, and that it’s providing a pretty good experience of functional programming on the &lt;abbr title='Common Language Runtime'&gt;CLR&lt;/abbr&gt;. But—and I fully grant that a fair bit of this kind of thing is almost entirely subjective—it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; good in the same way that Elm or Rust do. There is something very difficult to nail down here, but I get a vsiceral experience of joy when writing some languages and not others. Again: that will vary person to person, but I think there are things that make it more or less likely. Things that make it more likely, at least for me, include everything from self-consistency and predictability at the semantic level to the way the code lays out and flows at the visual/syntactical level.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sadly, F♯ just doesn’t hit the right notes&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for me. I’ll be much, much happier to write it than C♯ at work… but I really just want Elm and Rust and Idris to come save the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am of course writing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of functional code in our JavaScript; JavaScript is a surprisingly good language for it.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not that OOP is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, exactly; it’s just that what passes for OOP in languages like C♯, Java, and yes, F♯, is relatively low utility to me—and I think OOP ideas are much more interesting and useful when applied at a systems level, e.g. in an Actor system, than at the level of individual “actors” within the system. Compare Erlang/Elixir: functional components, organized in what is arguably an &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; object-oriented way.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temptation extends beyond this book; O’Reilly’s &lt;em&gt;Programming Rust&lt;/em&gt; (Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff) reads as the same kind of defensive introduction to Rust for C++ developers.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, nerds, syntax &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter. Try reading this sentence, nicely punctuated, and with spaces and capitalization. Now: tryreadingthissentencewithoutpunctuationorspacesorcapitalization. There may be a point after which it becomes less important, and a range of things which are equally good in an absolute sense, but it matters.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pun not intended, but inevitable given the language names here.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I’ll update it with books as I finish them, and I’ll also update it with reviews (even of the “here’s a brief comment” variety) as I do them. This is something I’ve been thinking about doing for my own sake for a while, and bumping into &lt;a href="http://tbrown.org/notes/2017/06/23/reading-and-sharing/"&gt;this post by Tim Brown&lt;/a&gt; reminded me how much I want to be sharing what I read with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get myself spun up on thinking that I need to be reviewing books with the best of them. In reality, I really just want to do like Tim says in that post (emphasis his):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am reading and sharing ideas about what I have read, I feel like my best self. &lt;em&gt;I want more of that feeling.&lt;/em&gt;… I’m wondering if acknowledging what I read, along with a substantial visual (a book cover image?) and any highlights or notes, could feel just as good as having a physical book…. Maybe I could list my piles of books here on my website, and link them to blog post entries with highlights/notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it exactly. So I’m going ahead and doing the work: I’m going to keep that list up to date, and I’m going to try to write and share &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about every book I read for the rest of the year. It doesn’t have to be a lot—just a sentence or two will do in many cases. “I liked it” or “This had a lot of potential but didn’t quite measure up to it.” Something simple like &lt;a href="https://wynnnetherland.com/reviews/to-hell-and-back-europe-1914-1949/"&gt;what Wynn Netherland does&lt;/a&gt;, or something long and careful when it makes good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday I’ll be able to write one of those killer reviews that ends up changing a whole conversation, or maybe I’ll just have a bunch of interesting notes I can look back on later and be able to see what I thought about a book when I’m curious a decade later. Either way, I think it’ll be a nice win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017-book-list.html"&gt;book list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There have been a number of fairly high-profile misbehaviors on their part—most notably, &lt;a href="http://applehelpwriter.com/2016/07/28/revealing-dropboxs-dirty-little-security-hack/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;—and then this past week, they started sending me notifications advertising Dropbox for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/bad-dropbox.png" alt="Notification ads are the worst." /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Notification ads are the worst.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I was with Google a few years ago &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/goodbye-chrome.html" title="Goodbye, Chrome: You&amp;#39;re just too creepy now."&gt;when they pushed me over the edge&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; with notifications!—I’m out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind Dropbox’s wanting to have a sustainable business. To the contrary: as I often note, I’m quite willing to pay for software I use, and I currently use a number of paid services where free alternatives exist because I’d rather do that than pay for ads.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mind when a company—&lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; company—decides that building their business means mistreating their users and customers. And harassing me with notifications about a variant of their product I don’t care about certainly crosses that line. Combine that with the misbehavior &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the fact that Dropbox has a tendency to hammer my system for no apparent reason, and, well, I’m out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="transition-plans" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transition Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="file-syncing" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;File syncing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For basic storage and access to files across my devices, the shift will be pretty easy: I already have paid iCloud storage for backing up Photos (it’s far easier and comparably priced to all the other options, so that’s what we use). So everything I’ve &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; doing with Dropbox I’ll be doing with iCloud Drive instead. And I have &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more overhead there with a 250GB plan that I do in my current 9GB of Dropbox storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="file-sharing" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;File sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For things where I need to share files with other people, I’ll be using &lt;a href="https://droplr.com"&gt;Droplr&lt;/a&gt;. If or when I find a need to share something for a longer period of time, more often, or with more people, I’ll think about the Pro plan, but for right now the free plan will &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than suffice for, say, sending an audio file to &lt;a href="http://independentclauses.com"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; for editing &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; episodes. (Also, iOS 11’s Files app &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/files-app" title="iOS 11&amp;#39;s Files app FAQ"&gt;will support&lt;/a&gt; this sharing workflow natively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-writing-setup" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My writing setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; vexing (or at least: vexing-seeming) change here will be to my writing workflow. For a long time, I’ve made an alias pointing from a folder in Dropbox on my main machine into the clone of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com"&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt; on that machine where I manage my website.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That has meant that I can edit the source version of a given post anywhere at any time, with any editor that has Dropbox integration. That was a winning combo for a long time, and it’s one thing I actually &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do with iCloud Drive. (I tried, and it sort of works, for a little while; but iCloud Drive doesn’t seem to expect this scenario. In its defense, it’s a weird setup.) I realized in thinking it through this evening, though: it doesn’t actually matter to me with the ways my workflow has shifted—and, perhaps just as importantly, with the way that the iOS ecosystem has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of options for directly editing files from Git repositories on iOS now. I don’t need to have it in Dropbox to be able to open it in any one of several &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; iOS writing environments, whether to make a quick edit or to create a post from scratch. Both &lt;a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/"&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://git2go.com"&gt;Git2Go&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well. But for another thing, I currently can’t &lt;em&gt;generate&lt;/em&gt; the site without logging into my home machine anyway.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So if I need to make a tweak, well… &lt;a href="http://www.blink.sh"&gt;Blink.sh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.panic.com/prompt/"&gt;Prompt&lt;/a&gt; will let me log in remotely and do what I need to. And a little bit of Vim or Emacs will let me make any quick edits that way if I really feel I must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one side effect of realizing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is that I can easily enough just copy a file from iCloud storage to my site’s working directory after writing it in a writing folder in iCloud if I so desire. Sure, that’s a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; finicky, but for the most part I won’t really need to mess with it: I can just &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; from my iPad, &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; on my iMac and be ready to do whatever I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="other-apps" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle is the other “apps” that have made a home in my Dropbox. The reality, though, is that almost none of those actually matter to me. I don’t even look at the majority of that data, and other pieces of it —backups of GPS and heart-rate data from workouts, or copies of all my tweets from when I wanted to maintain a microblog on this site, for example—are really just needless at this point, as I have all of that data stored in &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; cloud platforms (in the case of workout data) and/or don’t care about being able to retrieve it (in the case of tweets). I can happily just shut those things down and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="in-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it: goodbye Dropbox; hello other tools. (This post written from an iPad, and stored in iCloud Drive before publishing.) It’s been a long, and mostly just-fine ride, but I’m getting off here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure here: I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a Dropbox paying customer—though that is the fault of their perhaps overly aggressive early customer acquisition strategy. I have never &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to pay for Dropbox, even though I have many gigabytes stored in it, because I earned so much free storage for inviting other users early on.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19305033/why-is-putting-git-repositories-inside-of-a-dropbox-folder-not-recommended"&gt;You don’t want a Git repo sitting inside your Dropbox folder&lt;/a&gt;, but a symlink like this works just fine: you don’t end up with the conflicts that can happen with a full repo in Dropbox.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to change that a bit in two ways in the future, by having the generator live on a not-my-home-machine server and by making Lighting much easier to just drop in and use than my finicky Pelican setup currently is. But that depends on actually making Lightning, you know, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I was recently contacted by the team behind &lt;a href="https://writeapp.co"&gt;Write!&lt;/a&gt; and asked if I would take a look at and review their app, and I was happy to obliged. I tested the app out fairly thoroughly by doing what I normally do with my writing apps: putting together a blog post or the like. I’ve written this review from start to finish in it, across my two Mac machines. I promised the authors an unbiased review, so here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write!&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes itself as a distraction-free text editor. It enters the market in an interesting way: the Mac offerings here are numerous, varied, and excellent. Offerings on Windows are fewer and further between, and in my experience of much lower quality. Distraction-free text editors outside the world of &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt; text editors barely exist at all on Linux, as far as I can tell.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Write! is cross-platform, targeting all three of these. And that, as we’ll see, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the story of this particular app—for good and for ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-good" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the good: the app seems to perform relatively well. Text entry, even on a fairly large document, is smooth and quick. (I imported the text of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/realism-and-antirealism.html"&gt;this ~7200-word paper&lt;/a&gt; to test it and it didn’t stutter a bit.) Especially given the time I’m going to spend on the not-so-good below, I want to take a moment to applaud the developers for getting that right. It’s one of the most important aspects of an app like this, and any number of apps I’ve used just fall down on large documents. Everything I’ve seen here makes it seem like Write! would handle much larger documents even than that paper with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app’s main writing area looks fairly nice, and the distraction-free/full-screen mode gets out of the way readily enough. The cloud sync that comes with the app is quick and seems reliable. I’ve worked on this document across the two Macs I use, with no sync issues whatsoever. The writing area also has a (toggleable) overview of the document on the right, &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Sublime Text. To the left is a toggleable outline view, which lets you drill down into the structure of your document if you have multiple heading levels. And within the writing area itself, you can expand and collapse sections demarcated by headings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the experience of writing in the app is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. Not &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, but genuinely nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-just-okay" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Just Okay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit of a delay before any open tabs are hidden in that fullscreen mode, but it’s otherwise fairly typical of most “distraction-free” writing environments in that regard. The colors chosen for the light and dark writing themes are fine, but not great. Much the same is true of the typography: it’s relatively pleasant, if bland. There are a number of built-in themes, but no apparent way to customize them to be more to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app also features built-in autocomplete—but I’m not really sure who the target audience is for auto-complete in this kind of environment. It’s not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, per se, to have it, but it doesn’t add a lot of value for &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to, say, programming), and I turned it off fairly quickly in the process of writing this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="publishing" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app includes some “publishing” tools. Currently it supports writing to either Write’s own site, or to Medium. Medium publishing is nice—it’s certainly the hip tool &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt;—but you’re out of luck if you use WordPress, much less something like Ghost.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing to Write! itself seems to be mostly a way of letting people see in-progress drafts. The links aren’t particularly friendly, and while they’d be easy enough to share to Facebook or Twitter or the like, they have serious downsides over any of the free blogging options out there for anything other than getting some early feedback—there’s no organizational or navigational structure available, and for that matter nothing that even ties it to your name! At a minimum, Write! should clarify what this is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="business-model" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Business model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business model here is a curious mix: they’re selling the app at $19.95 (USD), with a year included of their custom sync solution. That sync solution is one of the things they advertise most heavily, and while I can attest that it works well, adding another, bespoke sync solution to my life is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on my list of things I’d like to do. It’s particularly an issue from where I stand because it doesn’t actually get me any benefits over a syncing solution using Dropbox or iCloud, both of which I’ve used extensively with other writing apps in the last few years, with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add onto that the fact that the sync and future updates become an annual purchase—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting one year after purchase, Cloud access and maintenance updates are $4.95/yr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—and any of the myriad other editors look much better: they all just use a sync engine I &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; use and like, and they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have annual fees for a service I don’t care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That goes double when you consider that I’ll often do different phases of drafting a given post in different editors, depending on the kind of content and what I’m doing with it. For example, I often use &lt;a href="https://caret.io"&gt;Caret&lt;/a&gt; for drafting technical blog posts, but at times I’ll switch over to using &lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; for working on the details of a given code snippet. If I’m using Write’s custom sync solution, my documents don’t exist in a normal folder on my machine, so they aren’t available for that kind of easy switching and editing. Double that &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; because it also means I don’t have access to the content on my iPad—where I often use &lt;a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/"&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://1writerapp.com"&gt;1Writer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bywordapp.com"&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt; to work on posts when I’m away from my Mac. There are no upsides for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, as far as I can tell, to using their sync system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this in the “just okay” section, however, because I can imagine that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be nice for someone who’s not already invested in an existing sync solution. Whether or not there are enough of those people out there to support the business model—I suspect not—is a separate question to whether it’s good or bad for users in a direct sense. Again: the custom sync system works well; I just don’t know whether it’s necessary (or worth the development time that had to be spent on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the business model on the whole: I’m not at all opposed to paying for good apps on an ongoing basis. To the contrary, I actually &lt;em&gt;embrace&lt;/em&gt; it: as a software developer myself, I recognize that there are few (if any) other sustainable business models. However, the application needs to be pretty amazing to get me to buy it in the first place, still less to justify a recurring purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-bad" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad to say, from my perspective—to be clear, as a long-time Mac user with &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html"&gt;very high standards for my writing tools&lt;/a&gt;—this isn’t an amazing app. In fact, &lt;em&gt;on macOS&lt;/em&gt;, it’s actually a bad app in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="non-native-ui" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-native UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Write’s UI looks and behaves like a Windows app. It’s built on &lt;a href="https://www.qt.io"&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt;, which does support native(-looking) widgets, but the developers chose not to use them – I assume in the interest of speed of development. If you’re on Windows, that’s fine. But this app will never look remotely native on macOS,&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and given the plethora of other really high quality writing apps on macOS—some of them with their own publication options!—there’s just no reason why you would pick this over one of those at that most basic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples should illustrate how painfully non-native this app is visually. First, note the window action buttons in the upper right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/write-app-review/draft.png" alt="not native windows" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;not native windows&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are Windows window action buttons; the normal Mac action buttons simply don’t exist! Similarly, there’s a slide-out menu that appears when you tap the hamburger in the top left:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/write-app-review/slide-out-menu.png" alt="slide out menu" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;slide out menu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably nice, though not totally native-feeling, way of tackling the menu problem… on Windows. On Mac, it’s just duplicating the functionality of the normal menubar. And when I say duplicating, I mean it exactly: those menus are the same as the ones the app puts in the real menubar; there’s no reason for them to appear within the body of the app, other than that the app isn’t designed to work without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right-click behavior is strange: instead of the normal Mac (or even Windows!) menu, they’ve supplied their own, and it’s actually its own little modal window, not a menu at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/write-app-review/right-click-modal.png" title="right click modal" alt="right-click modal window" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;right-click modal window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely see the utility of the little modal, but most other apps I’ve seen with similar approaches do it on highlighting some text. That way they can leave the normal right-click menu in place, which helps keep the user comfortable in their normal workflows. That’s going to be particularly annoying if you happen to make heavy use of macOS’s services menu—I don’t use it often, but when I want it, I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a number of standard keyboard shortcuts don’t work the same way, or don’t work at all, in Write! as they do in native Mac apps. Navigation controls aren’t quite right: &lt;kbd&gt;⌥&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;→&lt;/kbd&gt; jumps to the start of the next word instead of the end of the current word; &lt;kbd&gt;⌥&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;←&lt;/kbd&gt; doesn’t skip over punctuation; both stop on e.g. apostrophes in Write! (they skip over them natively). Other common shortcuts are bound to the wrong things: &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;⌥&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;-&lt;/kbd&gt;, for example, increases heading size instead of inserting an em dash. &lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Delete&lt;/kbd&gt; doesn’t do anything; neither do &lt;kbd&gt;^&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Space&lt;/kbd&gt;, (normally used for bringing up the special-character selector) or my beloved &lt;kbd&gt;^&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;K&lt;/kbd&gt; (“kill to end of line”) or &lt;kbd&gt;^&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;T&lt;/kbd&gt; (“transpose characters around cursor) combos.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I imagine the list is longer; that’s just what I noticed in the course of writing this review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most egregiously, Write! steals the keyboard shortcut &lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;`&lt;/kbd&gt;, normally used to switch between windows on macOS, to focus itself. Failing to implement and indeed overriding text input commands is one (very bad) thing; this is another kind of failure entirely. Apps should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; override core system behavior with their shortcuts! The fact that you can customize them doesn’t make this better; and the one time I &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to customize it (to turn off stealing the switch-window shortcut) it ended up overriding the &lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt; key’s behavior to create new documents instead of to, well, enter the letter “a”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of apps get some of those more obscure ones wrong, sadly, but proper use of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretext"&gt;Core Text&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; for a native app in my book—and missing those super common ones is a big no-no. I simply won’t use an app long term that doesn’t do that, because I find the mismatch between the rest of the OS (and my muscle memory!) and what the apps do too frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="markdown-support" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Markdown support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app claims Markdown support, and it &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; has it. But the goal is clearly to have a rich-text editing experience which can translate Markdown into whatever the underlying format is on the fly, and then export it back out when desired—&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be a Markdown writing application. You can see direct evidence that this is their approach by writing in Markdown and e.g. creating italics with * characters. When you view the exported Markdown, it’ll be using _ characters instead. Other little things flag it up equally: Markdown items don’t get converted to their rich text implementations unless you add a space or some punctuation after typing them; if you go back and wrap words in link syntax, for example, or try to make it bold with a pair of *s, it won’t be converted at all. The export still works fine in that case,&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but it certainly doesn’t come off well for the writing experience in the app, inconsistent as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t support Markdown itself fully or properly. Inline backtick characters (`) don’t generate inline code snippets. Instead, they generate standalone code blocks, as if using the usual four-space-indent or triple-backtick markers for code blocks in the actual Markdown spec and as supported in other apps. Nor can I find a way to insert hrules/divisions with triple-stars or triple-dashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="other-nits" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other nits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other small but significant problems as well. One is related to the business model: you actually have to sign in to start using the app. Granted all my positive comments about subscriptions above, it’s still the case that needing to sign in to a &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; app (especially just to use the app for local documents!) is a non-starter for me. As with so many of the other negatives I noted, this is a compromise that I don’t need to make, because the other alternatives don’t force it on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a bunch of basically rough edges. Pasting with &lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;V&lt;/kbd&gt; does indeed paste the text… and scrolls you to the top of the current document every time. A number of times, the selection of a given option failed: it simply wouldn’t stick. Other times, especially when selecting the default text theme, cursor selection seemed broken. I’m not sure whether those are problems with the Qt engine, the implementation, or some of both, but again: not a good look, especially in a crowded market. Right-clicking, beyond the problems mentioned above, also just wouldn’t work consistently. Sometimes I would right-click and the menu would close immediately so you couldn’t take any actions in it at all—probably a result of using a modal instead of a normal menu there. Regardless of the reason, it was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the app is unsigned, which means that it literally won’t open by default on macOS as of a few versions back. Users can certainly get around that, but they shouldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to: there’s no excuse for not signing a paid app for macOS (or Windows! But I’m not sure what its status is there) in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting approach for an editor. Trying to build a truly cross-platform app, and especially one that isn’t using web technologies like &lt;a href="https://electron.atom.io"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, is an admirable goal—in fact, it’s one that I may dare to tackle myself at some point. Cross-platform UI is also a very hard problem, and unfortunately this app makes clear just how difficult it is by falling down so often on really important details. In reality, the only way to do it well is to write all your core business logic in a way you can share and then supply actually-native user interfaces. Anything else will inevitably feel out of place at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, Write! is deeply compromised as a Mac app, to the extent that I simply cannot recommend it for Mac users. If you’re on a Mac, you should look instead at &lt;a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bywordapp.com"&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://caret.io"&gt;Caret&lt;/a&gt;. All of them feel much more native, and though they have different strengths and weaknesses, they’re all native (or mostly-very-effectively native-acting, in Caret’s case) apps. That doesn’t mean Write! is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;; it just means it’s not worth your time (a) if you’re on a Mac or (b) if you really care about standard Markdown behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted, though, the developers got some important parts of this &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; right: the app performs well, it looks decent on Windows, and their sync engine seems incredibly solid. Accordingly, if you’re on Windows, and don’t already have a particular commitment to Markdown proper, I might even cautiously recommend it—as a replacement for something like the old &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8621"&gt;LiveWriter&lt;/a&gt; app, for example. The biggest hesitation I’d have there is the business model—and, as noted above, I’m not opposed in principle to subscription models for good apps; but I’m not really sure what the value proposition here is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the app is named “Write!” – not “Write”. It’s not my favorite, not least because it means you have to type an exclamation point every time you write (!) it.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for that, including things to do with many Linux users’ antipathy toward paid or non-open software, which makes it very difficult for not only developers but especially &lt;em&gt;designers&lt;/em&gt; to make a living. Never mind the incredibly small size of the audience by comparison.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who knows if Medium will still be around in five years? But that’s for another post another time.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or Linux, but then what exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; native on Linux anyway? 😏 More seriously, this will look out of place on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Linux desktop environment.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These latter ones are sadly too often the case for cross-platform tech; I’ve filed issues on &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; in the past that way.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll actually give Write! one point over Ulysses here: Ulysses does some similar conversions under the hood to make the writing experience seem snazzier, and things which don’t get turned into their custom “text objects” can end up exported &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strangely.&lt;a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

And about rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans and lists may not sound like rest to you; that’s fine: they don’t to me, either. I’ve been eager to move back into the kinds of reading I’m actively interested in doing now that I’m done with my seminary degree. But one of the challenges is that I need—and I’m &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; aware of this need—to decompress a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last roughly 8 years have been &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; fairly constantly. I began my first job after college the day after Jaimie and I got back from our honeymoon. For the next two years I worked full-time there &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; taught myself web development and then did 8–10 hours a week of web development consulting on the side while she finished school. I kept up that pace for another year and a half after that other than a slight break just after Ellie was born, and then we moved to North Carolina for me to get an M. Div. from &lt;a href="http://www.sebts.edu"&gt;SEBTS&lt;/a&gt;. Since we moved here, I’ve always been working—anywhere from 20 to 60 hours a week, always in at least one class a semester and often as many as three. All along the way, I’ve also been reading and writing for myself: these things are relaxing for me. And for the sheer joy and need of a good outlet, I added podcasting along the way as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the takeaway of all of that is that I’ve had to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; structured and disciplined with my time. I have always had a detailed schedule and an idea of what I wanted or needed to be working on at any given time: from learning new things in software to writing blog posts, and from actually programming as a job to writing papers for seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to breathe a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very keenly the need to &lt;em&gt;decompress&lt;/em&gt;. Not to stop doing things, but to add some slack to the schedule, to keep my number of hard external commitments low and to keep any self-imposed pressures low as well. That will let me recharge and avoid burnout, and it will give me lots of good time to just hang out with Jaimie and our little girls. We’ve made space for the family all the way through, but it has always been a matter of scheduling it and fitting it in. I’m looking forward to a season where it’s just normal for us to play and read and do life together. As I said: a kind of decompression, letting things stretch back out a bit and decreasing the tension of always being on a tight schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that until about January 2018, I am not making myself a &lt;em&gt;reading list&lt;/em&gt; in the way I want to in the future. Why do I even want that? Because I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it. So the better question is: why do I think I need a reading list or a plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a voracious, multi-disciplinary reader, but this has two problems. One is I can be a bit like a squirrel: always seeing something shiny in that new subject &lt;em&gt;over there&lt;/em&gt;. The other is that I can get sucked incredibly deep into one genre so that I end up reading only theology or programming or the like for six months. Having a plan and a reading list will help me both dig deeply and in focused ways into the subjects on which I want to think (and write!) more, but it will also help me balance that with a good mix of other kinds of reading from other fields—something which is both broadly helpful and which inevitably &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/art/and-the-stew-tastes-good/"&gt;produces a better mix of insights&lt;/a&gt; than just reading one subject in isolation does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for all the reasons outlined above: not now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have books I want to read over the rest of this year. The list right now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fyodor Dostoevsky, &lt;em&gt;The Idiot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Kahneman, &lt;em&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oliver O’Donovan, &lt;em&gt;Resurrection and Moral Order&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandon Sanderson, the various sequels to &lt;em&gt;Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians&lt;/em&gt; (which I read and quite enjoyed last month)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Taylor, &lt;em&gt;A Secular Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, &lt;em&gt;Beren and Lúthien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a “list,” but it’s a list composed of exactly one kind of book: whatever I feel like reading. There are other books I’ve already started that aren’t on that list because while they’re important to me, they’re not decompressive at all: they feel like work, like pressure. And what I and my family need right now—especially in the midst of planning a cross-country move to be nearer our families in a new home!—is to relieve pressure, not add more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I’m going to go read one of those books on our porch. Whichever one I feel like. And then I’ll read whichever one I feel like &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt;. And if the list changes, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

That means that at this point I have over a decade of theological thought “on record” as it were. You can look at things I wrote in 2006 and have some idea where I landed on many a theological issue, and for that matter in my slow maturation in my faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly unsure about the tradeoffs that go with this. Being able to trace someone’s theological and personal trajectory has its upsides, in the case of significant theological figures. But I am not a significant theological figure, and even to speculate that someday I might be seems hubristic in the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the things I have written have a great deal of standing in the eyes of Google and other search engines: they are old, have various links which point their way, and in several cases are one of only a few posts (or posts still up) on a given book. I feel—and feel the more keenly the further distant from their writing I get—the weight of responsibility for those words. They are public and they have some influence (even if small); if I mislead by leaving them online, that certainly outweighs whatever “benefit” I or someone else might find in their being online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written and talked before about the problems of link-rot, and those problems are real. But there is also this: link-rot is a problem for content of &lt;em&gt;significance&lt;/em&gt;, of &lt;em&gt;importance&lt;/em&gt;. Even granting that what is significant or important to one person may be very different from what is significant or important to another, much of what I have written online certainly is neither significant nor important. Would it be so bad a thing for some random ramble—&lt;a href="http://blog.chriskrycho.com/2007/01/dangerous-obsessions.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, say, from a decade ago—to go away? No. It wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things occur to me here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, if things are worth saving, they are likely worth saving in a form that is not merely digital. &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb" title="&amp;quot;The Cobweb: Can the Internet be Archived? by Jill Lepore&amp;quot;"&gt;Excellent&lt;/a&gt; as the work of the &lt;a href="https://archive.org"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is, and diligently as any individual may work at preserving their own content (as I have to date), things do break. If Blogger shuts down, I will have archives of my old site, but if in some horrible event my machine and all its backups &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; failed… well, that content would be lost. Things truly worth keeping are probably worth keeping physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights another reality, though: when you start to consider what, exactly, you consider valuable enough to &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt;, you start to realize how little of value is on a website like my old blogs. That’s not to say they didn’t have value of all sorts when I originally wrote them—perhaps they did and perhaps they didn’t—but if, a decade on, you can’t see a reason to keep them around in hard copy, you might well wonder if there’s a reason to keep them around at all. More and more, I think the answer is probably &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no reason to make this an all-or-nothing affair. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; things in the murky depths of my web history I’d like to keep around—book reviews, mostly, but also perhaps a few other relatively high-traffic posts with which I still largely agree, or others with which I now disagree but which that is useful to me in some way. For example, I can readily enough think of times when it might actually be helpful to me at times to be able to point to two different posts from different times in my intellectual development and say: I was &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; here and I now think &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what this points to is not the need for universal preservation, for holding on for dear life to everything I have published online. Rather, it suggests that &lt;em&gt;curation&lt;/em&gt; is valuable. Or, to use a word we might have used in an earlier time with a less haphazard and hyper-individualized approach to publishing: &lt;em&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; is valuable. In this case, that editorial work might simply be my own culling and deciding what to keep and what not to. But the more material I generate, the more valuable I think that kind of trimming is. With it comes the work of figuring out to present that kind of “archival” material—what qualifiers to prepend to it, for example, and where on the site it should live, and how to make sure that links still work even if I move the actual content around on the site… in short, doing this well is a lot of work. But more and more I think: do that work, or shut it all down. There’s too much noise as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, as I have suggested before:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I need to print these things (if only for my own long-term curiosity). And then, as I have not suggested before: I need to throw some things away, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, given the content of this post: perhaps only in a microblog post I am apt to delete entirely from my site in short order.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 21:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2017-05-07:/2017/on-public-theological-histories.html</guid><category>writing</category></item><item><title>Odd Bits and the Occasional Long-Form Essay</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/odd-bits-and-the-occasional-long-form-essay.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of congratulating me on finishing up my M. Div. classwork a few weeks ago, an acquaintance noted—as a joke, but with more than a kernel of truth to it—that he was looking forward to &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; podcasting and more blogging from me, what with my freer schedule. I laughed and agreed: no doubt I will have a bit more time for both (though I don’t currently plan to add any more podcasts to the already long list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the things I’m considering carefully is what &lt;em&gt;theological blogging&lt;/em&gt; will look like for me now, and in the years ahead. Most of the theological content on this site in the past four years has come directly out of my coursework. (Click into the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/theology/"&gt;Theology section&lt;/a&gt; of the site and see how many items are tagged &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/sebts/"&gt;#sebts&lt;/a&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of them.) My theological writing before that (&lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.chriskrycho.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) was largely a mix of the &lt;em&gt;exploratory&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;response-to-current-events&lt;/em&gt; kinds of blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the exploratory category, I was working out my thoughts on given topics in public. My &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/topics/devotions/"&gt;personal devotions&lt;/a&gt; posts back in 2013 fit well here: these were basically reflecting “out loud” on whatever I was studying in the Bible any given day. In the &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; category, I was laying out how I’d already come to think on a given topic, in the hopes it would be helpful to others. &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/will-of-god/"&gt;This post from 2013&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.chriskrycho.com/2010/11/debt-and-dogged-discipline.html"&gt;this post from 2010&lt;/a&gt; are both good examples of that. My &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/category/articles/reviews/"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt; fit somewhere else in that mix, too—a bit of both of those, probably. And finally there were the (even then rather rare for me) &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/theology/an-aspen-in-a-forest-of-pines/"&gt;responses to other articles&lt;/a&gt; out there. All of those are a good kind of blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I’m not particularly sure I want to be doing any of them quite like I was three to five years ago—and I’m &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; sure I don’t want to be doing it like I was ten years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I’ve found my voice as a technical writer. I know that I can site down and work out even a fairly complicated subject in software in a voice that is approachable and engaging, and which people seem to enjoy reading. But at the same time, I’ve “lost” my voice as a theological writer, though &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; is the wrong word for it. It’s not so much that I couldn’t write the way I did a few years ago, but that I don’t want to. I’m glad for people doing that kind of casual blogging, and I still read a few of those blogs (mostly by friends). But I mostly quit reading &lt;a href="https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/justintaylor"&gt;Justin Taylor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/kevindeyoung"&gt;Kevin DeYoung&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/thabitianyabwile/"&gt;Thabiti Anyabwile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or any of the others I read regularly a few years ago—they’re generally publishing good material, and I think they’re a gift to evangelicals. But very little of what they’re saying is particularly interesting to me at this point. They’re doing great topical work. I’m much more interested in looking at structural and systems-level questions, or at things which really can’t be addressed well in the 500–2,000-word range, but require a long essay at a minimum or even a book to tease out the nuances of. I was starting to feel that way a few years ago; and my experiences in seminary have (in ways that might not be exactly what you expect of a seminary experience&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) sharpened that profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; on things theological, whether those be theology proper, or theological anthropology, or the ways those press out into ethics and culture and politics and family life and so on. But not so much in the regular-blogger-tackling-current-issues way. People are doing that, and doing it well. Go read &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/matthewloftus/"&gt;Matthew Loftus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/samuel/"&gt;Samuel James&lt;/a&gt; over at Mere O; read &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com"&gt;Alan Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; read Alan Jacobs—read anyone you find helpful along those lines. It just won’t be me. I’m far more interested in essays than in blog posts at this point in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, what I’m going to be doing here, I expect, will be more in the “thinking out loud about topics I’m chewing on” vein. Snippets, not long blog posts—but perhaps pieces of things on the way to being full-blown essays. I’m thinking hard about something I’m calling “algorithmism” (you can follow the bits I’m reading online on that subject &lt;a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:chriskrycho/t:algorithmism/"&gt;via Pinboard&lt;/a&gt;). Don’t expect regularity, and certainly don’t expect hot takes or even commentary on what is current. Odd bits and the occasional long-form essay are more likely to make appearances here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of whom, amusingly enough, ended up at &lt;a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org"&gt;The Gospel Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing which has changed in the last five years is that indie bloggers are even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; rare; the move away from individual sites and toward blogging networks which was hitting when I started seminary has turned into a &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; standard.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because SEBTS was an incredibly academic school which turned me into an overly-academically-minded person. Perhaps I’ll write on that more in the future, but it’s totally ancillary to this post.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I have also spent a considerable amount of time trying to come up with a good way to share links, and have been rather stymied by the limitations of the static site generator I use (&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;): it does not support customizing the link target of RSS items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these desires, combined with the breadth of my interests, have been motivating factors in my desire to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/lightning-rs/"&gt;build my own CMS/site generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as of today, I think I am setting aside those two needs, at least for the present (though the underlying information architecture needs for my site are not thereby particularly diminished, so Lightning will still aim for roughly the same goals when i get back to it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reasoning here is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple reality is that the vast majority of my microblogging has zero historical value. It is ephemeral; archiving it is essentially a useless gesture, a “because I can” or perhaps “the internet should be permanent” act of defiance. But in truth, if every one of my tweets vanished… it would not matter one whit. I have been considering this for some time, but it came home to me tonight while considering my second point:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting with &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; as a bookmark management service over the past few weeks, spurred on by yet once more needing to dig out if an email from three years ago a particular post. (You can see my public bookmarks &lt;a href="https://pinboard.in/u:chriskrycho"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a work in progress as far as organization goes.) One lovely Pinboard feature (and there are &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2016/07/happy-birthday-pinboard.html"&gt;many others,&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/07/pinboard_turns_seven/"&gt;having a simple, profitable business model&lt;/a&gt;! Yes, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a feature as far as I am concerned) is the option of public RSS feeds for publicly-bookmarked items by author, by tag, etc. This is actually what led me to Pinboard in the first place (thanks, &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2011/05/pinboard.html"&gt;ayjay&lt;/a&gt;). My Pinboard RSS feed is &lt;a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:chriskrycho/" class="uri"&gt;http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:chriskrycho/&lt;/a&gt;, and if you want to follow along and see what I think is worth reading with occasional comments… that’s where it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing this post, I also remembered that last night, App.net shut down. I downloaded my archive a few weeks ago… I think. Honestly, I don’t recall, and the truth is that I haven’t looked at old posts there in years, though I amassed some 15,000 in the years I was active there. ADN was beautiful and wonderful. But even the very good conversations I had there are &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; in much the same way a conversation when physically present with each other would be. We do not suppose we need audio/video recordings of conversations just in case we might want to search them later. I understand why someone might want to &lt;a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/03/app-net-archive.html"&gt;archive all of ADN&lt;/a&gt;. But I don’t feel that desire myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archival has value. But its value is not ultimate, and its value is not universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The somewhat-ephemeral things I care about archiving are, I find, &lt;em&gt;links&lt;/em&gt;—not random thoughts or comments or even conversations, but articles and posts I want to be able to come back to later, or quickly find to share with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no more microblog posts here. If you want them, you can follow me on Twitter. (If I hear from enough people who would prefer to keep getting them via RSS, I will think about setting up some sort of automated RSS mirror of my stream.) But for my own part, I am content to let the ephemeral be ephemeral. And that is easier to countenance now that microblogging isn’t also a poor-man’s bookmarking tool for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes me around to the meta point I had in mind when I started the post: use tools for what they’re good at and don’t try to force them into roles they’re not well-suited for. Twitter is good for ephemera, bad for permanence, decent for finding content I wouldn’t encounter via RSS, horrible for conversation or substantive commentary. Pinboard is great for bookmarking things, for sharing links via RSS, and for seeing what bookmarks others are sharing; but it is not at all “social” in the modern sense, with no facilities for discussion or interaction other than reading others’ links and copying them to your own board. Twotter for ephemera and trivial conversations. Pinboard for links. Blog for longer content.&lt;/p&gt;

Blogging does me good. &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/a-few-theses-on-blogging.html" title="A Few Theses on Blogging"&gt;I say this&lt;/a&gt; often, but I’m finally coming to a point where it might be a bit more doable. Finishing my M. Div. is giving me more time, and that’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wonderful. The trick now is deciding which of the many things I want to do will get my attention. I can split my focus a thousand ways, or I can pick a few tasks and zero in on them and aim to be good at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of blogging, I have no doubt it’s something I want to continue. But I need to think about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I want to use it, and this relates closely to some of my goals for an information architecture-level restructuring of the site I want to do when I finish building &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;lightning-rs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Blogging&lt;/em&gt;, at its best, isn’t long-form articles (though there is certainly room for those on my website as a whole), but &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/samuel/2017/02/17/4-requests-young-evangelical-writers/" title="4 Requests to Young Evangelical Writers"&gt;short, cogent pieces which pack a punch and move on&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/01/those-darn-millennials.html" title="those darn millennials?"&gt;thinking out loud&lt;/a&gt;. Even in my own experience, the best &lt;em&gt;blog posts&lt;/em&gt; I have written are quite different from the best &lt;em&gt;essays&lt;/em&gt; I have written. Embracing that seems like a helpful first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have more than a few large project-style blog posts I have not finished—most regrettably, at present, one about podcasting which I told a friend I was working on some weeks ago—in part because I have tried to treat them like blog posts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; essays or projects at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think I’d like to end up with is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; like this, in terms of structure in the new site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;—something like a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book"&gt;“commonplace journal”&lt;/a&gt;, but shared publicly. This would include several kinds of content:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blog posts—things like this little piece, of course, but also the &lt;em&gt;vast&lt;/em&gt; majority of the content I put on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;links to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt; Series&lt;/strong&gt;—the home for more substantive chunks of content
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-running series like my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; posts, which are not particularly &lt;em&gt;bloggy&lt;/em&gt; (for lack of a better word)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things like my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;2016 in Review&lt;/a&gt; series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some projects more like some of the things &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com"&gt;Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt; has done over the years: curated collections of materials that complement each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articles&lt;/strong&gt;—call this aspirational; if or when I have things published in a more formal way, I’d like them to have a home on my website as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure has some challenges of its own, of course. Where does a poem go? Is it part of my “journal” or is it more of a one-off “project”? And within those, I shall want both overlapping “categories” as well as cross-cutting “subjects”: it is impossible to cleanly separate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my Tech and Theology writing from each other, yet having &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; high-level categories grows increasingly important for navigating the site as its content grows. (This becomes a problem even just for me as I look for old posts to link them—much less for any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reader of my site!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem with all such taxonomies is that they are arbitrary and constrictive so far as they cannot overlap. Perhaps something goes in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;—but then that makes it far harder for a user of the site to navigate. And here, as I hinted in my parenthetical above, there is another of these tensions: how I think of something and use it for organization of my materials is broadly orthogonal to the needs or interests of potential readers, and both of us use the site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are problems for all sufficiently complex collections of data. It is equally as hard to manage these questions of organization for large, focused writing projects (like a thesis or a novel) as for a varied collection of materials like this site, though the details differ. It is much &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; when dealing with an operating system and its collection of myriad kinds of data. We muddle on with our self-imposed limitations, because the alternative tends to be chaos. Unconstrained tagging systems quickly devolve to madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is not merely a digital problem: filing cabinets have the same constraints. Yet perhaps the apparent &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; offered by the digital world exacerbates it; the sense that perhaps we could escape the constraint that a note can only go in one place—because it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; go in more than one virtual place—makes us reach for solutions which may only increase our frustration in the end. Perhaps just being forced to put something in a place (even if not a perfect one) is a good discipline. But perhaps not; perhaps that freedom is a gift if we use it wisely. I think there is room for further work here in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: more to come as I continue to chew on these problems of information architecture and user interface. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho"&gt;Links to others’ thoughts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=Structuring%20content"&gt;more detailed comments of your own&lt;/a&gt; most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been on my mind a lot lately. (And what follows is, appropriately, as you will see, blogging in the old style—which is to say: a bit rambly. I apologize. It’s the coffee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend at our small group meeting tonight mentioned his intent to start blogging this year. He had a lot of good reasons for jumping in, and I strongly encouraged it. Blogging is not for everyone—we’ll get to that—but blogging is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. This newish thing, writing-on-the-web-in-a-log, has been a part of my life for over a decade now. I wrote my first post on Xanga in the fall of 2005, and I have not gone more than a matter of weeks between posts since. It is not hyperbole to say I cannot imagine &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; blogging at this point. (The sheer number of words I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html" title="So. many. words. I had no idea how many words."&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt; should serve to drive home that point: even in a year which was full to the brim, I somehow ended up publishing almost 70,000 words.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, blogging is not at all like it was in when I started in 2005. Both for good and for ill. The mid-2000s were in many ways the height of blogs’ power and reach. Individual sites still hosted all their own content; blogging networks were nascent; and the ability of small content providers to outdo the old guard was beginning to be felt at all levels. Bloggers made a difference in the 2004 election not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; different than the way Twitter shaped all sorts of politics in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter. That brings us to one of the things that has changed. Microblogging is new. And social media more generally has changed a great deal. Facebook was still the fledgling upstart nipping at MySpace’s heels when I published that first post on Xanga. Today, Facebook dominates the web, and Twitter—not even a product at all in 2005—has taken enormous chunks of the time and attention of the would-be writerly class (journalists especially).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first took my own blogging &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="http://blog.chriskrycho.com"&gt;the Blogger site&lt;/a&gt; which first ran in parallel with and then displaced that Xanga. And Blogger, too, evokes a different time: when individuals setting up blogs was trendy, and when the competition between WordPress and Blogger could be called a competition. (Much-neglected Blogger trucks on still, but WordPress powers perhaps a quarter of the sites on the web.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all that, some things haven’t changed. Business plans still matter—and Ev Williams, founder of Blogger, Twitter, and Medium, still hasn’t figured out something truly sustainable. Attention-driven advertising of the same sort that powered Blogger then and now, and which powers Twitter and Facebook equally, continues to be a race toward the bottom. Sustainable publishing on the web is a mirage for all but a few, because &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/"&gt;content is plentiful and distinguishing features few&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;s of the world are notable, these days, not least for how few of them there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, there is something real to mourn in the passing of the web of those early days when I started blogging. People &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; own their own content (at least, to a far greater degree than now). Blogs linked to each other, using &lt;a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/comments/pingbacks/"&gt;ping-backs&lt;/a&gt; to let sites know when they’d been linked. Comment sections flourished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that era also required a level of technical knowledge that was simply too high a bar for most people. To be sure, anyone could set up a blog with enough grit, and WordPress and Blogger lowered the bar. But subscribing to another blog meant wrangling RSS and learning the arcana of managing Google Reader (which soon swallowed all competitors before its own too-delayed demise). Twitter’s “follow” button seems a revelation by comparison; it is no wonder at all that first Tumblr and then Medium embraced the idea of blogs-as-social-media, “following” and all. Being able not only to respond, and only if the author so allowed, but also to &lt;em&gt;initiate&lt;/em&gt; with anyone else on the service… the first time you @-mentioned someone well-known in your circles, and they responded—that was (and is) a heady thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralization is often a function of convenience. Facebook and Twitter make it simple for you to “connect with” or “follow” whomever you like. No digging for RSS feeds, wondering if they have a non-standard symbol for it or hoping desperately that it’s at the root of the site + &lt;code&gt;feed.xml&lt;/code&gt;, or (if you really know the secrets of the web) that they set it up as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with a &lt;code&gt;rel='alternate'&lt;/code&gt; tag so it could just be discovered automatically by a smart-enough feed reader…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see? If you aren’t technical yourself, your eyes just glazed over in that paragraph, and that’s the point. The technical details make sense if you understand them. But understanding them is hard; and more to the point, they don’t matter for what people actually want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental mistake of Manton Reece’s new &lt;a href="http://micro.blog"&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; project (which I like in principle, and whose goals &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/micro/"&gt;I clearly share&lt;/a&gt;). People as a whole don’t even know there might be a reason to prefer the open web, where everyone owned their own content and there was no central clearing-house of information. Facebook offers real value to people: it shows them things they’re interested, and keeps them coming back precisely by tailoring its algorithm to make sure they don’t see too many things they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want to see. (The polarization that helps foster may be dreadful, but it’s &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/fake-news/"&gt;very good business&lt;/a&gt;.) The same goes for Twitter, regardless of the structure of its timeline: people self-select into their lists of whom to follow. Manton’s project is a good one in many ways—but the problem it solves is a &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/5.03/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; kind of problem, and one that takes a lot of selling when the problem Facebook solves is obvious: &lt;em&gt;I want a new story and a picture of my cousin’s kid and a funny cat video.&lt;/em&gt; Decentralizing, whatever its benefits (and again: note well my &lt;em&gt;bona fides&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), makes those basic tasks &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve followed what is now the micro.blog project from a distance for years now—and I’ve always had this one, nagging but oh-so-important question. &lt;em&gt;How does this solve a &lt;strong&gt;user&lt;/strong&gt; problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, if there is one, is a decades-long play. It’s a hedge against technological oligarchy. But how do you get people to care? What’s the pitch? The technical problems are easy compared to that—and the technical problems &lt;em&gt;are not easy&lt;/em&gt;; they remain almost untouched in the last decade, and micro.blog has no intent to address some of the core issues. Real-time interaction is what makes Twitter Twitter; ping-backs aren’t even close. And that’s just Twitter; Facebook outstrips it by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Medium? Medium doesn’t know what it wants to be when it grows up (and it never has; the same as Twitter). As a second pass at Blogger, it has better aesthetics and something like a mission. Ev &lt;a href="https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we are shifting our resources and attention to defining a new model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they’re creating for people. And toward building a transformational product for curious humans who want to get smarter about the world every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a lovely-sounding sentiment. It’s also—for today, at least—contentless business blather. “Building a transformational product for curious humans who want to get smarter about the world every day” sounds great, but it doesn’t mean anything. Medium is a beautiful product without a reason to exist. (How often do you see a founder basically admit: &lt;em&gt;We have no idea what we’re doing here&lt;/em&gt;? But that’s roughly what Ev did.) That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t exist. It just means no one has thought of a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; reason for it to just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium as a centralized, social medium for longer-form writing is better than nothing. I’ll take Medium + Facebook + Google over just Facebook + Google any day. But is there something lost when every blog post looks the same, and when everyone is locked into one more centralized platform? Yes. Just as there is something &lt;em&gt;gained&lt;/em&gt; by people having a place to look. The questions are: whether the costs are indeed higher than the benefits; and even if so whether people can be persuaded of those costs when they all take a decade to appear, and Medium is really pleasant to scroll through &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By whatever quirk of temperament, I’m old-school about blogs. I’d love for the open web to win out over all the centralizers. That’s not going to happen: &lt;em&gt;centralization provides too much value to users&lt;/em&gt;. But we can hope the open web will flourish alongside centralized sources. And, far more importantly, we can work to that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can show people why it matters, and teach them how to own for themselves even the things you publish on Facebook. We can make philosophies like &lt;abbr title="Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere"&gt;&lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE"&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; easier to implement (because right now it’s just plain &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;). We can let Twitter be secondary and our own blogs primary as a way of setting an example. We can do the hard technical work of figuring out something like real-time, decentralized, better-than-ping-back commenting-and-threading-and-responding for all sorts of content on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even solving those technical problems will require us to recognize that the bigger and more important problems are &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; problems. It’s going to require distinguishing, for example, between &lt;a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426"&gt;the web we have to save&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/12-31-0817.html"&gt;mere ephemera&lt;/a&gt;. If there are goods of how-blogging-was-in-2008 that are worth keeping, what if anything do they have to do with whether the content of nearly any Twitter account is “owned” by the user who generated them? Will the user care, two decades from now? (Or two days?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, we need to care about the open web not in some general or abstract sense, and certainly not just on its technical merits, but instead—and quite specifically—as one means of serving other people. If we cannot express it in those terms, we show that we do not understand the real problems at all. It wouldn’t be the first time a bunch of technically-oriented nerds missed the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017! (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I really only have a few big goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of smaller goals, too, of course. That list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically all of those are flexible (and, if I’m honest, so is #6 in the first list—though it’s a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; priority as far as the flexible ones go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good handle on how I’m going to chase those things. The productivity patterns I’ve established over the last couple years are serving me well so far, and I expect them to continue to. After graduation, things will obviously look a little different, and I’m looking forward to that, too. Being able to take vacations where I’m not losing ground by not working on school projects? That sounds truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking forward to digging into more books I want to read and making progress on writing I want to do in the realm of theology, philosophy, ethics, and so on. I’ve spent nearly all the mental energy I have available for those subjects on seminary work over the past several years (with varying degrees of value for that effort). Once again being able to focus my own external studies as I like will be very freeing, I think. I hope to find some ways to continue to work at something like an academic level, and—crazy though it sounds right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;—I do hope to get a Ph.D. in &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in a few decades. But I am looking forward to having a lot of years of reading and writing outside academia between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those goals are good, but ultimate I’m willing to just see what the year brings. I’d love to compose music again more regularly and at greater length. I’d love to write more fiction, and more (and better) poetry. But we’ll also be starting some schooling with Ellie, and dealing with the logistics of planning a move to Colorado sometime in late 2017 or the first half of 2018. We’ll be enjoying just not having nearly so much to do right after finishing seminary. It’s worth remembeirng to rest, and not do just jump into another season of being incredibly slammed by busyness. I plan to take some time to read novels and play video games, too. Those things are good for our souls in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And come what may, I hope to glorify God in the midst of it. Rest, work, play, side projects, you name it—&lt;em&gt;soli deo gloria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a number of points over the last few years, I’ve tackled the question of productivity. I always have far more I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done than I’m able to actually get to. A few of those posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;Boosting My Productivity&lt;/a&gt; (December, 2014)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;A New Schedule: Trying to make better use of my time toward my goals&lt;/a&gt; (July 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of all productivity plans, of course, is that one can get more focused on the details of the plan than on actually being productive! I’m happy to say, however, that this &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; the case for me with these productivity approaches. First, I have never allowed myself to be slavish about them. If I need to do something different on a given day, I do something different. Second, I am generally able to remember that the point of the plan is &lt;em&gt;what I’m getting done&lt;/em&gt;. So with that in mind, some comments particularly on the plan I sketched out &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;mid-year this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell off that wagon almost immediately. Readers who’ve stuck with me through these various updates will note that this ambitious plan preceded my disastrous 20-mile run and the ensuing bout of walking pneumonia by a matter of days. It took me until September to get back on the horse, so to speak, because even after I got over being sick, I was traveling—and nothing throws off my schedule like traveling! Happily, I got quite a bit done both during the conference trip I took and during the week I was in Colorado for my youngest sister’s wedding, but it wasn’t until after both of those that I was able to settle back into the routine I’d aimed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major themes of that post were a detailed plan for my days, cutting out a lot of my social media, and thinking about weekends. The detailed plan for my days I kept off and on. I never consistently managed to have the block of time-for-side-projects at the end of my days, and that increasingly meant those things cut into weekends (impacting that goal as well). As for social media, that’s largely been a success: I now rarely get on Facebook, and only check Twitter from time to time. Certainly neither is much of a timesink anymore. I do continue to make heavy use of Slack outside of work, but I’ve found a good balance there (and the main communities I’m a part of have gone through their own adjustments as we’ve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; found the need for this kind of focus and balance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it wasn’t perfect, but I did find it a very useful approach overall. I fully expect to stick with something very like it in 2017. Hopefully I won’t be pulling as many 10–11 hour days as I was in the latter half of 2016—but regardless, building this new discipline around the overall structure of each day was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; part of my approach to productivity that I’m definitely going to keep is the “pomodoro” technique. I first mentioned this in the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; discussion I posted about this, but I’ve embraced it more and more. I work in 25-minute blocks, punctuated by 5-minute breaks. Nearly all of those 5-minute breaks entail walking, and as a result I get about 2–3 miles of walking in every day on top of my runs. That helps enormously with focus. This fall, I also embraced the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; half of the pomodoro technique: writing down goals and outcomes for each of those 25-minute blocks. Even more than the daily goals I discussed in the opening post of this series, this lower level of tracking has proved very helpful. It has given me a sense of what I have actually accomplished each day, and it has also helped me &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; as I’m trying to keep moving on various tasks each day. I highly recommend using the pomodoro approach (adapted as necessary to your particular circumstances, of course) as a tool for that kind of focus and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be remiss if I didn’t also note the following &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; substantial factors in my productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fitness/health:&lt;/strong&gt; if I’m active, I focus better. People say they don’t have time to exercise; I mean it when I say I don’t have time &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. I keep it pretty simple: running, cycling, swimming, and body-weight strength stuff. But I do it basically every day. And we eat fairly healthily. Both of those are incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; no matter how busy I am, I don’t pull all-nighters or anything of the sort. I get a minimum of 6 and usually 7–7½ hours of sleep every night. Even when I’m tired from pulling week after week of 10-hour work days, I can keep going because I get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no commute:&lt;/strong&gt; working remotely is awesome for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that I don’t lose the hour or three every day to the road/subway/etc. that many people I know do. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time over the course of a year. 48 working weeks means if you commute for an hour total every day, that’s 240 hours a year—that’s 30 8-hour days worth of “getting things done”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point after I finish seminary I will expand the various things I do in productivity into a more complete series, but this gives you a good idea of what 2016 looked like, and what I expect 2017 to look like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source. (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at Olo was a great year overall. I very much enjoy working with the people there, the tech stack is good and they’re paying me to do what I love, and if the product isn’t lighting my world on fire (online restaurant ordering is cool, but restaurants aren’t a passion of mine), that’s a tradeoff I can live with. Working with good people with a good tech stack on a product you find &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; is actually pretty great. I’m grateful for previous jobs, but this one has superceded them in every possible way. I’m &lt;em&gt;glad&lt;/em&gt; to start work every day—and in truth, there have been more than a few days where I would have liked nothing more than to keep writing JavaScript rather than switching over to do some reading and writing for seminary. That bodes well for my future plans: post-seminary, I expect to bump from 30 to 40 hours a week with Olo&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and keep making our software as awesome as I can. And I expect to enjoy that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of numbers: GitHub reports that I contributed +29,463/−13,726 lines of code in our new mobile web ordering experience, which I helped build nearly from scratch this year. (That “negative” is stuff I rewrote or removed entirely by finding a better implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a bit of my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; this year was technical, too: some ~33,000 of the words on my blog—fully a third of the things I published on this site apart from microblog posts and schoolwork—was about software. That included entries 11–18 of my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, but about 20,000 words were assorted discussions of JavaScript, Rust, podcasting, functional programming, etc. A fair bit of that content came out of things I worked on for Olo, either directly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html" title="What is Functional Programming? (And why should we care about it?)"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;) or indirectly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/keyof-and-mapped-types-in-typescript-21.html" title="keyof and Mapped Types in TypeScript 2.1"&gt;this discussion of TypeScript 2.1&lt;/a&gt;) That’s a good mix, and I hope to continue putting out material that’s useful to others as well as interesting to me. (I do get tweets now and again confirming that the content is helpful, and I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; run analytics on the site at all—so if you like something I write, please tell me. It’s encouraging. And that goes for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; author you read, as a rule.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I actually did a little bit of open-source contributing this year. Not as much as I’d like, but a little. And I also count New Rustacean as a pretty substantial contribution to the Rust community. The fact that it isn’t code doesn’t diminish what it’s doing. If you’re feeling like code is the only thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; counts, recognize that all the code in the world isn’t that useful without explanations of how to use it, helping people become interested in the first place, and so on. Speaking of non-code contributions, the open-source contribution I’m &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; proud of is certainly the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636"&gt;Rust RFC&lt;/a&gt; I wrote and which was recently accepted and merged. It proposed (and it is now the official policy of the Rust project) that no new features may be added to the (stable version of the) language or the standard library without first being documented. This is a big deal for the language, and it was also a big deal for me, in that it was another place where—despite being far too busy to write a lot of Rust code this year—I could make a real difference in a community I’m passionate about. And one of my goals for next year is a direct follow-on from that: &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;actually implementing the requirement&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big thing going on for me in the software world is that I started work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a new static site generator in Rust. (There’s another such project, &lt;a href="http://cobalt-org.github.io"&gt;Cobalt&lt;/a&gt;, which is already usable.) I’ve been pushing up against the limits of &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, my current generator, for a while. And I’ve looked around time and again, and never found a CMS or SSG that does everything my peculiar publishing needs require (&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a way that I like!). And my needs are indeed peculiar, though probably not wholly unique; for most people, any one of &lt;a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; other site generators&lt;/a&gt; would work just fine. So I’m doing what I’ve been thinking about doing for years, and building my own. My immediate goals are mostly just to have something that is super speedy and which checks off all my needs from a CMS/site generator. My longer-term goals include getting some good foundational knowledge I’ll need for &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a thousand lines in, and have some pieces working. I hope very much to move off of Pelican and onto Lightning (and get a freshened theme for this site) in 2017!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Olo has been incredibly generous and hired me as a full-time employee at 30-hours-a-week with pro-rated salary. Like I said: amazing company.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19h 39m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, several of those numbers surprised me a bit. For one thing, I had to put New Rustacean on hiatus starting in October courtesy of the crunch I ended up with from the &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project colliding with the other summer-and-fall commitments I had. For another Stephen and I paused Winning Slowly between Seasons 4 and 5 (as we usually do) and also have taken a mid-season pause on Season 5 because of end-of-semester crunches for both of us and then his wife having a baby a few weeks earlier than expected. Yet in spite of that, almost 20 hours of audio content this year! If I hit that again in 2017, I’ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;sap.py&lt;/a&gt; will be back, I have no idea. I love making the show with Jaimie, but it’s really up to her whether she wants to keep working on Python. Of late, she’s been working on &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PemberlyPrintables" title="Jaimie&amp;#39;s printable shop on Etsy"&gt;printable art&lt;/a&gt; instead, and that’s delightful in its own right. I’ve &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/14/"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; gotten &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;Run With Me&lt;/a&gt; going again in the past day; I got off track when my headphone microphone stopped working for a bit and never got back &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; track when it started working again. I’m looking forward to once again talking about running while running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be publishing an even wider variety of kinds of episodes of New Rustacean in 2017. Listeners should get another couple of interviews, a lot more of the “here is a Rust concept in detail” episodes (at least one a month in general, I hope!), news episodes, undoubtedly a few bonus episodes, and a new “Crates You Should Know” format designed to highlight crates I’ve found useful in my own Rust work. I continue to find Rust a wonderful language, and I hear regularly that this is one of people’s favorite programming podcasts. I hope to keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to wrap up &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html" title="Winning Slowly Season 5: Structure and Agency"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; mid-spring, and then begin recording Season 6 mid-to-late summer. All of that is pending how things go as Stephen finishes his dissertation and likely prepares to move across the country to take a job as a professor somewhere, of course. But that’s the plan—and yes, we already know the rough shape of Season 6, even this far out. We know the season topic, and have some basic ideas of where we want to go with it. As is usually the case with our “seasons” now, it will take ideas we’ve touched on here and there and turn them into a full-blown, months-long exploration of those ideas as applied to specific issues. Winning Slowly remains one of my very favorite projects, not least because there is (to our knowledge) nothing else out there doing quite the same thing. Tackling long-term trends in technology with a distinctively (though not always overtly) Christian perspective (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a reductionist one) is apparently our gap to fill. We’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other podcasting-related bits. First, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/theses-on-podcasting/" title="32 Theses (and several more words) on Podcasting"&gt;~5,000-word piece for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt; explaining how the medium works, what its constraints are, and what is involved in doing it well. If podcasting is interesting to you, I think the piece is well worth your time—precisely because of, and not in spite of, its length! Second, I gave a pair of guest lectures for Stephen at N.C. State University this fall, which are both available in the &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-bonus.html"&gt;bonus section&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;. Those cover some of the same ground as the piece at Mere O, but they also talk a lot more about the details of finding a topic, an “authorial voice”, and an angle for your show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2016 was to continue writing not only on this blog but in other outlets. I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of writing this year, but relatively little of it is published. But here’s a look at some of the numbers! Note that “This site” excludes republication of school papers, and that I don’t have an exact count for the school papers because I’ve already discarded a few of the shorter pieces, but their average length is well-known to me. More on the unpublished &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project below.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Words&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~130,500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;This site&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~63,000&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~9350&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~207,850&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the writing for school, only a small fraction of it is &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;, unlike previous years. Roughly 75,000 words of that content is research notes I put together for an independent study I did—which was deeply profitable for me in terms of thinking through hermeneutical and theological systems, and which will hopefully be helpful for the professor for whom I prepared them, but which are not at all publishable. Another 10,000 of those words fit in a category charitably describable as “busy-work” and publishing them is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; but would have no &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. The school-writing also includes the notes and manuscripts for my sermon-delivery class. You can find those sermons &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons/"&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well well, with audio, video, and the manuscripts available—but the notes are not worth publishing, as they’re entirely internal. Still: they’re words, I wrote them, and there are a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I wrote one of the papers I’m proudest of from my entire seminary career in the spring: &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/realism-and-antirealism.html"&gt;Realism and Antirealism—A key debate in the philosophy of science (with interesting implications for young-earth creationism)&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy with it not least because I wrote it in a very compressed fashion because of some family health issues that hit at the end of that semester, and it still turned out extremely well because I had &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; it meticulously. Despite having only a single draft with one typo-level revision pass, it’s easily the best paper I’ve ever written. It turns out that doing a really careful outline helps when you’re working at this scale. I’ve not normally been a fan of outlining (and I’ve not normally found it helpful when I’ve tried it), but for any longer, more sustained argument, it’s absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the content on this site (excluding republication of school papers), an astounding ~14,000 of those words are in my “microblog” content. It’s amazing how much those little posts add up. That said, I’m surprised to see that I’ve put out as many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; words as I have this year on this site, and the total there is rather staggering. Writing on this site includes everything from &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/ask.html" title="Ask: a short story"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/to-paint-god-as-a-man.html" title="To paint God as a man: an Advent poem"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-simple-childrens-catechism.html"&gt;a simple children’s catechism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html"&gt;an introduction to functional programming&lt;/a&gt;. I’m exceptionally pleased in retrospect to see how this came out, and I look forward to writing on equally varied terms in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 13,000 of the words I wrote for this site were in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, a project I’ve enjoyed enormously since starting it in 2015 and would like to get back to in 2017. It went on hold because I was offered, and accepted, a contract to write a 30–40 page report for O’Reilly comparing the two languages, which was intended to come out this fall. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way some wires got crossed and my pitch and what they wanted didn’t end up being the same. Once that became clear (at the beginning of October), they opted to drop the project. This was a huge disappointment to me: it was a small hit financially, but a big one time-wise, as I sunk a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hours into it in what was an already-very-busy fall; the project was over ¾ done when it was dropped.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few big lessons I learned from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overcommit. Even if the project had gone through without issue, it would have been more on my plate than I could reasonably handle. The fact that it was canceled after having done a lot of the work meant it was also &lt;em&gt;financially&lt;/em&gt; frustrating, but I had overcommitted regardless. Won’t do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; clear up-front about the terms and goals of a project. I don’t know how we ended up with the crossed wires we did, but it was extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can get an advance, get an advance. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m quite pleased with the &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt; of my output in 2016 (who wouldn’t be, right?). I’d definitely like a lot more of that to be public-facing in 2017, even if it’s lower in overall volume. I hope to take the material from that canceled &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project, expand it slightly, and self-publish it. I also hope to put together at least one substantive essay for Mere Orthodoxy next year. And of course there will probably be thousands of words in this space, too—inevitably more than I even realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note as well that this excludes all the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com/tree/589cd13225cde91f92bfca93f6679f2395d78886/docs"&gt;podcast scripts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this year! Those would add well over 10,000 more words to this count.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that number includes these posts!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted an analysis of when you’d choose each language; I pitched a comparison along similar lines to my blog series, looking at the language design choices as a view into software engineering tradeoffs. When the mismatch became clear, I pointed out that “when to choose Rust vs. Swift” is, generally speaking, a roughly two-sentence answer: “Choose Rust for cross-platform, high-performance/low-level code. Choose Swift if you’re writing apps on an Apple platform.” This was not, apparently, obvious to everyone else involved. In the words of the internet: &lt;span style="whitespace: nowrap"&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, hold on,&lt;/em&gt; you say. &lt;em&gt;Go back. How did you get walking pneumonia?&lt;/em&gt; This is a fun story, and it’s a huge part of what made the other parts of the latter half of 2016 go the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for what I expected to be a 15–16 mile long run as part of training for the half-marathon I signed up for this year. The previous week &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/12/" title="Run summary on runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;I’d done a 14-mile run&lt;/a&gt;, so 15–16 would have been no problem. I was feeling &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; on the run, so decided to extend it to 17. This was right at the edge of what makes good sense for a week-over-week increase in mileage; you generally want to stick with ~10% increases and max out at 20%; but 17 is right at that limit relative to 14. So I turned right to cut through another nearby town instead of left to head directly home when I was at roughly the 11-mile mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, where I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; cut back toward home, I took a wrong turn out of a five-way intersection. (You can see on the north end of the map, in Youngsville, &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/644619792" title="Run overview on Strava"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I realized this half a mile on, but figured there would be a spot to cut over. There is not. So I got back to where I had taken the wrong turn, filled up my water bottle and hit the bathroom, and made my way home. But at this point, I was already at ~15 miles, and ~4 miles from home. As I got back into our town, I decided: why not just go ahead and extend out to 20 miles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is, that extra three quarters of a mile probably didn’t matter a bit. 19.25 vs. 20 miles? Same difference in its effect on my immune system, which is to say: it completely crashed it. A 42% week over week increase in mileage is no joke. The little cold I picked up from my 2-year-old daughter turned into borderline bronchitis. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What with a busy spring preceding—I had no idea how much busier I would be taking 2 classes and working 30 hours a week than I had been taking 3 classes and working 20 hours a week—I didn’t manage a triathlon. I had contented myself with the thought that I’d likely set another PR in my half marathon, but after weeks of recovery from walking pneumonia, that thought fell apart as well. I lost about a minute per mile in my pace, and my mileage was shot as well. I never got it back—not least because of a writing project which went south on me. I ended up being sick off and on all fall, and I’m only now getting my feet back under me. Sad to say, one of those times I got sick was the week of the half marathon I signed up for, and I’d been getting loud, clear signals from my body on previous runs that I was pushing too hard. So no race &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; this year. But better that than pushing and injuring myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year also saw a so-far unreversed weight gain that I find incredibly frustrating. In the first six months of 2016, I gained about ten pounds—despite keeping up the same basic activity level. I attribute this to a combination of factors: metabolic shifts in my late 20s, shifting back to doing almost purely running rather than a mix of running, swimming, and cycling, and the impact of acclimation to a workout load. I’m far from overweight, but I’m also slower and generally a bit flabbier as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping 2017 is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better in all these regards! I plan to do a sprint-length triathlon and a full marathon. And I hope to lose those ten pounds again and get back to that healthier overall weight. That combo seems like the thing to do the year I turn thirty and graduate seminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;Part 2: So. many. words. I had no idea how many words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-3.html"&gt;Part 3: Podcasting: Winning Slowly, New Rustacean, and more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-4.html"&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 was a long, difficult, strange, sometimes wonderful and sometimes dreadful year for me. It was one of the most professionally and scholastically enjoyable and rewarding years of my life, and also one of the most exhausting. As I often do at years-end, I am taking stock publicly of what went well, what went poorly, and what I might do different in a variety of categories—here, mostly in terms of my public-facing endeavors. This year’s summing-up post will also (for, I think, the first time) include some numbers! But first, a few comments on the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/thoughts-on-2015-and-2016.html"&gt;offered a similar set of reflections&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of it, I laid out some plans for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I made the habit of writing these out formally on a day-by-day basis—and I did this off and on. If you were to look at my little (Moleskine-branded and delightful-to-me) daily planner, you’d see streaks of weeks where I noted specific tasks and whether I hit them or not, punctuated by weeks and months where I did nothing of the sort. I have always found it difficult to stick with these kinds of things, in part because I usually have a pretty good idea what I need to do on any given day without writing it down somewhere. (I use &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" title="OmniFocus"&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt; for tracking mid- and long-term deadlines for school.) In July, I started mashing this idea up with &lt;a href="http://bulletjournal.com" title="Bullet Journal site"&gt;bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and I found that I (a) really like the system and (b) also didn’t stick with it consistently. A lot of that came down to the fact that I got thrown off—horribly—by getting a mild-but-still-utterly-debilitating case of walking pneumonia in July. (On which, more in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for last year’s ideas about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I was going to hit those goals. How did I actually do at addressing them? The answer is: &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. 2016 was not an amazing year. It was not a terrible year. But it had as many downs as ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own walk with God remains &lt;em&gt;steady&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing amazing to report here, but I’m more than okay with that. I will perhaps say more on this in another post, but the older I get the more convinced I am that emotional highs are a trap. Sentiment and true religion are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same thing; and Scripture calls us to &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;spiritual feelings&lt;/em&gt;. As such, in a year with this many bumps, I am glad to say that I had no horrible falls, and I read my Bible nearly every day and prayed every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family learned some Bible verses, and started working on the Heidelberg Catechism. We shared the gospel with people as we were able, and met faithfully with our church. We were not extraordinary, and we were far from flawless, but I think we did &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. I hope and pray in God’s grace we are able to continue in faithfully doing well in the years to come. Certainly if there is one thing I hope to do more of in 2017 it is spend time with my girls. I am not a huge “kid person,” but these years are precious and go by quickly; far better to spend more time with them and have a podcast episode or a writing project go out later (or not at all) than to miss these little years.&lt;/p&gt;

I think the main thing to say about it is that it’s gorgeous and a really great editor, and that there is nonetheless something about it which makes it feel not quite as &lt;em&gt;fluid&lt;/em&gt; as Byword always has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of them quite &lt;em&gt;nails&lt;/em&gt; it for my purposes, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither is quite there for text that includes a lot of code samples. (Basically: neither supports the GitHub variations on Markdown, which are incredibly important for &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;a lot of my writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither has the ability to do things like autocompletion of citations from something like BibLatex. (No standalone app does, to my knowledge.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ulysses’ most powerful features only work in its iCloud bucket. And they’re not standard: rather than embracing &lt;a href="http://criticmarkup.com"&gt;CriticMarkup&lt;/a&gt; for comments, they have their own. The same is true of e.g. their code blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ulysses &lt;em&gt;converts&lt;/em&gt; any other Markdown documents to its own custom variant when you open them. Had those documents formatted a way you liked (e.g. with specific kinds of link or footnote formatting)? Don’t expect them to still be that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Byword really does one thing well: opening and writing single documents. It does this extremely well, but it also has none of the library management that is useful for larger projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these apps are really wonderful in many ways, and I think it’s fair to say that they’re &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for many writers. &lt;a href="http://jaimiekrycho.com/"&gt;My wife&lt;/a&gt;, for example, does nearly all her fiction writing in Ulysses; it works wonderfully for her. But for the kinds of writing I do—usually technical in one way or another—it is limited in its utility. That’s not really a critique of the apps. It’s more the recognition that I have some pretty unusual requirements of my writing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I don’t think I’m the only person out there who has these particular needs. I am, for example, hardly the only person working with citations and academic text, or writing Markup with lots of code samples in it. And as much as you can bend general-purpose text editors like &lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; to your will,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it’s not the same as a dedicated writing app that focuses—in the ways that Ulysses and Byword both do—on just being a great tool for &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;. Writing and writing &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; are not the same, after all. A tool that’s really well-optimized for the latter isn’t necessarily well-optimized for the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your ears open. You might just be hearing more about this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I have: I have Zen mode installed, a custom Byword-like theme I use when I just want to write, and even a citation autocompletion package integrated with it. It’s not bad. But I still don’t love it as a first-choice &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; tool.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2016-03-26:/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html</guid><category>design</category><category>software development</category><category>writing</category></item><item><title>Academic Markdown and Citations</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/academic-markdown-and-citations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Much of my past few weeks were taken up with study for and writing and editing &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; for one of my classes at Southeastern. I’ve been writing all of my papers in Markdown ever since I got here, and haven’t regretted any part of that… except that managing references and footnotes has been painful at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnotes in Markdown look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Here is some text.[^fn]

[^fn]: And the footnote!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses no problems at all for normal footnotes. Academic writing introduces a few wrinkles, though, which means that this has always been the main pain point of my use of Markdown for writing papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many academic citation styles (including the Chicago Manual of Style, on which our seminary’s &lt;a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html"&gt;style guide&lt;/a&gt; is based) tend to have a long version of the footnote appear first, followed by short versions later. Nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; academic citations styles make free use of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibid."&gt;“ibid.”&lt;/a&gt; abbreviation for repeated references to save space, time, and energy. Here is how that might look in manually-written footnotes, citing the very paper in which I sorted this all out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[^fn1]

More text. Another citation.[^fn2]

What is this? Yet _another_ citation?[^fn3]

[^fn1]: So Chris Krycho, &amp;quot;Not Exactly a Millennium,&amp;quot; chriskrycho.com, July 22,

2015, http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html
(accessed July 25, 2015), ¶6.
[^fn2]: Contra Krycho, ¶15, who has everything _quite_ wrong.
[^fn3]: ibid.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems straightforward enough, though it is a bit of work to get the format right for each different kind of citation (articles, books, ebooks, electronic references to articles…). Things &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get complicated in the editing process, though. For example, what if I needed to flip the order of some of these notes because it became clear that the paragraphs needed to move around? This happens &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt; during the editorial process. It becomes particularly painful when dealing with the “ibid.”-type references, because if I insert a new reference between two existing references, I have to go back in and manually add all that the reference content again myself.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Pandoc and &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="managing-citations" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing Citations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of plain-text solutions to academic writing is not especially new; only the application of Markdown to it is—and that, only relatively. People have been doing this, and &lt;a href="http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/"&gt;documenting their approaches&lt;/a&gt;, for quite a while. Moreover, tools for managing references and citations have existed for quite some time as well; the entire &lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; toolchain is largely driven by the concerns of academic publishing, and as such there are tools in the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; ecosystem which address many of these problems.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such is &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;, and the later (more capable) &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibL&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;: tools for managing bibliographies in &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; documents. The &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibL&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; approach to managing citations in a document is the use of the &lt;code&gt;\cite&lt;/code&gt; command, with the use of “keys” which map to specific documents: &lt;code&gt;\cite{krycho:2015aa}&lt;/code&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not Markdown, of course. But other folks who have an interest in Markdown and academic writing have put their minds to the problem already. Folks such as Jon MacFarlane, the originator and lead developer of &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the single most capable text-conversion tool in existence. As it turns out, Pandoc Markdown supports a &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html#citations"&gt;citation extension&lt;/a&gt; to the basic markup. It’s just a variant on the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; citation style that feels more at home in Markdown: a pair of braces and an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, plus the citation key, like &lt;code&gt;[@krycho]&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, Pandoc knows how to use &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; libraries, as well as many others, and &lt;a href="http://citationstyles.org"&gt;Citation Style Languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;s) to generate markup in &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the format needed for any given citation style.[^citeproc]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing out all those citations details by hand, then, I can just format my footnotes like this (assuming the citekey I had set up for the article was &lt;code&gt;krycho:revelation:2015&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[^fn1]

More text. Another citation.[^fn2]

What is this? Yet _another_ citation?[^fn3]

[^fn1]: [@krycho:revelation:2015], ¶6.
[^fn2]: Contra [@krycho:revelation:2015], ¶15, who has everything _quite_ wrong.
[^fn3]: [@krycho:revelation:2015].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much simpler and, importantly, has the exact same form for each citation. Pandoc will take care of making sure that the first reference is in the long form, later references are in the short form, and repeated references are in the “ibid.” form as appropriate. It even renders a properly sorted and structured Works Cited section.[^styleset]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly complex command I used to generate a Word document from a Markdown file with citations (using my own &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library and the Chicago Manual of Style &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;) on the command line is:[^template]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pandoc revelation.md --smart --standalone \
--bibliography /Users/chris/icloud-drive/Documents/writing/library.bib \
--csl=/Users/chris/icloud-drive/Documents/writing/chicago.csl -o revelation.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an extended sample of this kind of usage in practice, take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.txt"&gt;Markdown source&lt;/a&gt; for the paper I wrote last week, using exactly this approach. Every footnote that references a specific source simply has a cite key of this variety. The header metadata includes a path to the bibliography file and a &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;. (These could be configured globally, as well, but I chose to specify them on a per-file basis so that if I want or need to use &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; styles or a separate library for another file at a later time, I can do so with a minimum of fuss. More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/downloads/revelation.docx"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the rendered result. You can see that it automatically generated everything right down to the “ibid.”-style footnotes. I made a few, fairly minimal tweaks (replacing the search &lt;abbr&gt;URL&lt;/abbr&gt; with an &lt;abbr&gt;ATLA&lt;/abbr&gt; database catalog reference and inserting a section break before the Works Cited list), and turned the paper in—confident, for the first time since I started seminary, that all of the references were in the right order and the right format. With carefully formatted reference documents (with their own style sets),[^reference] I was able to generate an actually &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;&lt;a href="/downloads/revelation-pretty.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; version of the paper from another Word document, as well.[^pdf]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, better yet, you don’t even have to put citations in footnotes. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning"&gt;@anjdunning&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning/status/625415216575197184"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; response to the original version of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/chriskrycho"&gt;@chriskrycho&lt;/a&gt; Don’t put citekeys in a footnote: write everything as inline citations and it will also generate notes when asked by CSL def. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning/status/625415216575197184"&gt;∞&lt;/a&gt; July 26, 2015 17:19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my standard example from above, then, you could simply do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some text in which I cite an author.[@krycho:revelation:2015, ¶6]

More text. Another citation.[Contra @krycho:revelation:2015, ¶15, who has
everything *quite* wrong.]

What is this? Yet _another_ citation?[@krycho:revelation:2015]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will generate the same markup for my purposes here; and as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anjdunning"&gt;@anjdunning&lt;/a&gt; noted, it goes one step further and does what’s appropriate for the &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;. This might be handy if, for example, you wanted to use the Chicago notes-bibliography style in one format, but switch to a simpler parenthetical citation style for a different medium—or even if you had a paper to submit to different journals with different standards. Having the citations inline thus has many advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are still times when you might want to split those out into distinct footnotes, of course. That second one is a good candidate, at least for the way I tend to structure my plain-text source. I find it useful in the case of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; footnote content—i.e. text that I’m intentionally leaving aside from the main text, even with reference to other authors—to split it out from the main flow of the paragraph, so that someone reading the plain text source gets a similar effect to someone reading the web or Word or &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; versions, with the text removed from the flow of thought. In any case, it’s quite nice that Pandoc has the power and flexibility such that you don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you don’t actually &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the brackets around the citekey, depending on how you’re using the reference. If you wanted to cite the relevant author inline, you can—and it will properly display both the inline name and a reference (footnote, parenthetical, etc.) in line with the &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt; you’ve chosen. If I were going to quote myself in a paper, I would do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;As @krycho:revelation:2015 comments:

&amp;gt; This was a hard paper to write.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; powerful, and while I didn’t take advantage of it in my first paper using these tools, you can bet I will be in every future paper I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="all-those-references" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;All those references&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as is probably apparent, managing a &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library by hand is no joke. Entries tend to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="tex"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@book{beale:revelation:2015,
        Date-Added = {2015-07-20 21:16:02 +0000},
        Date-Modified = {2015-07-20 21:21:05 +0000},
        Editor = {G. K. Beale and David H. Campbell},
        Publisher = {William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company},
        Title = {Revelation: A Shorter Commentary},
        Year = {2015}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a lot of utility in having that data available in text, on disk, no one wants to &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; that by hand.[^noone] Gladly, editing it by hand is not necessary. For this project, I used the freely available &lt;a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net"&gt;BibDesk&lt;/a&gt; tool, which is a workable (albeit not very pretty and not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; capable) manager for &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="//cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/bibdesk.png" title="Not very pretty, but it does work" alt="BibDesk – open to the library for my Revelation paper" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;BibDesk – open to the library for my Revelation paper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I filled in the details for each item and set a citekey for it, I was ready to go: BibDesk just stores the files in a standard &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file on the disk, which I specified per the Pandoc command above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BibDesk gets the job done alright, but only alright. Using a citation and reference management tool was a big win, though, and I fully intend to use one for every remaining project while in seminary—and, quite possibly, for other projects as well. Whether that tool is BibDesk or something else is a different matter entirely. (More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="to-the-web" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To the web!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted something more out of this process, if I could get it. One of the reasons I use plain text as a source is because from it, I can generate Word documents, &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt;s, and &lt;em&gt;this website&lt;/em&gt; with equal ease. However, Python Markdown knows nothing of &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; or citekeys, to my knowledge—and since I render everything for school with Pandoc, I have long wanted to configure &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; to use Pandoc as its Markdown engine instead of Python Markdown anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, I actually set this up about a month ago. The process was pretty simple:[^pelicanconf]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I installed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jstvz/pelican-pandoc-reader"&gt;pandoc-reader&lt;/a&gt; Pelican extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set the plugin path in my Pelican configuration file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I specified the arguments to Pelican I wanted to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only additional tweaks necessary to get citation support were calling it with the &lt;code&gt;'--filter pandoc-citeproc'&lt;/code&gt; arguments, which lets it process any bibliography data supplied in the header metadata for the files. Calling Pandoc with &lt;code&gt;--bibliography &amp;lt;path to bibliography&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (as in my example above) is a &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html#citation-rendering"&gt;shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for calling it with &lt;code&gt;--metadata &amp;lt;path to bibliography&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; arguments. I could just supply the bibliography directly in the call from Pelican, but this would limit me to using a single bibliography file for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my posts—something I’d rather not limit myself to, since it might make sense to build up bibliographies around specific subjects, or even to have smaller bibliographies associated with each project (exported from the main bibliography), which could then be freely available along with the contents of the paper itself.[^smarter] (On this idea, see a bit more below under &lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word of warning: Pandoc is much slower to generate &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; with &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the filter, and the larger your site, the more you will feel this. (The time to generate the site from scratch jumped from about 10s to about 30s for me, with 270 articles, 17 drafts, 2 pages, and 1 hidden page, according to Pelican.) Pandoc has to process &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; article to check for citations, and that’s no small task. However, if you have Pelican’s content caching turned on, this is a one-time event. After that, it will only be processing any new content with it; total generation time is back down where it was before for me: the effort is all in generating the large indexes I use to display the content for the landing pages and for category and tag archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result: that same paper, rendered to &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/not-exactly-a-millennium.html"&gt;on my website&lt;/a&gt;, with citations and works cited, generated automatically and beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="other-site-generators" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other site generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the situation around using Pandoc itself in other generators, including Jekyll—I simply haven’t looked. I do know, however, that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some tooling for Jekyll specifically to allow a similar workflow. If you’re using Jekyll, it looks like your best bet is to check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"&gt;jekyll-scholar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby"&gt;citeproc-ruby&lt;/a&gt; project, which (like pandoc-citeproc) enables you to embed citations and filter them through &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt;s to generate references automatically. As a note: you should definitely be able to get those working on your own deployment sites, but I have no idea whether it’s possible to do them with the GitHub Pages variant of Jekyll. (If anyone who reads this knows the answer to that, let me know on Twitter or App.net, and I’ll update the post accordingly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-future" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing to use &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; with BibDesk as a way of managing my citations in the short term, I’m thinking about other ways to improve this workflow. One possibility is integrating with &lt;a href="http://scholdoc.scholarlymarkdown.com"&gt;Scholdoc&lt;/a&gt; as it matures, instead of &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org"&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe (hopefully, albeit unlikely) even contributing to it somewhat. I’m also open to using other citation library tools, though my early explorations with Mendeley and Zotero did not particularly impress me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are substantial advantages for the applications (and thus for most users) to maintaining the data in an application-specific format (e.g. an SQLite database) rather than on the file system—but the latter has the advantage of making it much easier to integrate with other tools. However, Zotero and Mendeley both natively export to &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; format, and Mendeley natively supports &lt;a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/tipstricks/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/"&gt;sync&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;span class="tex"&gt;BibT&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; library (Zotero can do the same, but via third-party &lt;a href="https://zoteromusings.wordpress.com/tag/bibtex/"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;), so those remain viable options, which I may use for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to look at making my library of resources available publicly, perhaps (a) as a standalone library associated with each project, so that anyone who wants to can download it along with the Markdown source to play with as an example and (b) as a general library covering my various reading and research interests, which will certainly be irrelevant to most people but might nonetheless provide some value to someone along the way. I’m a big fan of making this kind of data open wherever possible, because people come up with neat things to do with it that the original creators never expect. Not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; should be open—but lots of things should, and this might be among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty happy with the current state of affairs, the aforementioned interest in other reference managers notwithstanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can set up the citations &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;, in a tool designed to manage references, instead of multiple times in multiple places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use Pandoc and a &lt;abbr&gt;CSL&lt;/abbr&gt; to get the citations formatted correctly throughout a paper, including generating the bibliography automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use the same tooling, integrated into my static site generator, to build a web version of the content—with no extra effort, once I configured it properly the first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, this helps me meet one of my major goals for all my writing: to have a single canonical &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; for the content, which I will be able to access in the future regardless of what operating system I am using or what publishing systems come and go. Simple plain text files—Markdown—get me there. Now I’ve put good tools around that process, and I love it even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;general for long documents. If you try to name them manually, like I do for posts on my website, you will very quickly end up wasting time on the names. If you try to number them, they will end up out of order in a hurry. My own &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/web/markdown-and-academic-writing/"&gt;previous solution&lt;/a&gt; to this problem quickly became unwieldy for larger papers, and required a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hand-editing. Gladly, I no longer deal with that manually. Instead, I do all my drafting in &lt;a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, where you just type &lt;code&gt;(fn)&lt;/code&gt; and it creates a footnote automatically, and will move that footnote &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; around transparently as you edit, handling all the number-setting, etc. on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;typesetting system&amp;quot; and looks like &lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not lost on me… [^citeproc]: If you used the installers on Pandoc’s website, &lt;code&gt;pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt; comes with it. If you installed it via a package manager (e.g. by running &lt;code&gt;brew install pandoc&lt;/code&gt;), it may not have, so you’ll need to install it manually yourself (e.g. &lt;code&gt;brew install pandoc-citeproc&lt;/code&gt;). [^styleset]: All of the content, including the rendered footnotes and the bibliography, has sensible content types set on it: headers are headers, body text is body text, etc. You can then customize to match the specifications of your style guide. I have a Chicago/Turabian style set set up with the formatting rules to match. [^template]: Actually, it was even hairier than this, because I also had a &lt;code&gt;--reference-docx path/to/template.docx&lt;/code&gt; specified. If you think it’s perhaps a bit too complex, well, I agree. I plan to turn that into a command line alias in pretty short order, because remembering it every time is just not going to happen. [^reference]: Using the &lt;code&gt;--reference-docx&lt;/code&gt; argument to Pandoc, you can hand it a document that already uses your desired style set, so you don’t have to go in and apply it manually. [^pdf]: I could have done that with Pandoc’s &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; tools, as well, but didn’t really feel like taking the time to tweak the &lt;span class="tex"&gt;L&lt;span class="texA"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;span class="texE"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; template for it. [^noone]: Probably someone does, but not me, and not most people! [^pelicanconf]: If you’re using Pelican, you can take a look at my Pelican configuration file &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com/blob/ef3ecbca1765750392086355aeae026c1159d4b9/pelicanconf.py#L109"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the full configuration for using Pandoc this way. [^smarter]: Optimally, I’d really just prefer to be able to set &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these arguments at a per-file level—i.e., not use &lt;code&gt;--filter pandoc cite-proc&lt;/code&gt; unless the file actually specifies a bibliography. And I could hack Pelican to do that; I’ve actually already &lt;a href="https://github.com/liob/pandoc_reader/pull/5"&gt;messed around&lt;/a&gt; with other, semi-related bits regarding Pelican and Pandoc’s shared handling of &lt;abbr&gt;YAML&lt;/abbr&gt; metadata. But I’d prefer to keep my installation as “vanilla” as possible to minimize the cost of setting things up again on a new machine or after a crash, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with names for footnotes in Markdown can be painful in&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony of site for software which boasts that it is “a high-quality&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2015 13:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2015-07-26:/2015/academic-markdown-and-citations.html</guid><category>workflow</category><category>writing</category></item><item><title>Faithfulness</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/faithfulness.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a lot more than a month since the promised monthly update. I’ll blame it on a lack of self-discipline… or perhaps on the presence thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, we face choices about where to spend our time. In this particular season of life, that has often meant not writing, even things I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to write. I have a family to care for, a church to serve, work to do, and schoolwork to accomplish. Family is a daily endeavor, work and school nearly so, and church regular if not quite daily. In the midst of that, I have to decide: &lt;em&gt;What will I do today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture tends to put the question in terms of balance; my friend and pastor Ashok Nachnani suggested to me a while back that it is better to think in terms of &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;. “Balance” suggests holding all these things in equal proportion, juggling them against each other. “Faithfulness” suggests fulfilling the responsibilities as best we can, with the time we are given. The actual day-to-day outcome may not look particularly different, but it is an important shift in the way we think nonetheless. To be faithful may mean letting some desireable things go, and it may mean doing some things in a different way or to a lesser degree than we might like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; writing. I like keeping a public record for my friends and family to see how my life is. I enjoy stretching my mental muscles in the way that writing requires. I enjoy thinking through pen or keyboard. But faithfulness to the responsibilities God has given me right now means &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trying to balance those desires against each other, and instead doing what is best for my family and my church. For the most part, right now that means not writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I put it to Jaimie a while back, at this point in life I have time for one hobby—and only one. That hobby, at this point, is fitness. I run half marathons, and now I do triathlons (first one coming up in 10 days!). That takes up a non-trivial amount of time every week. It helps me in the other areas of my life, to be sure: it helps me be less physically tired, improves my focus in school and work, and serves to maintain my health. Nonetheless, it is hobby-like and it takes a substantial amount of time every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now, I write a great deal less than I want, and a great deal less than I did in college or early in our marriage. I miss the days when I had time to work on poetry for hours at a stretch, or simply to muse for a few thousand words. But it is far more important for me to spend time with Ellie and Kate than it is to write poetry, or to compose music, right now. Lord willing, I have 55–60 years ahead of me. Of those years, they will be close only another 15–20, and they will be the age they are today &lt;em&gt;only for today&lt;/em&gt;. As much as writing and composing and hobby programming all look appealing to me, and as much as those really are good expressions of the ways God has gifted me, focusing on them would not be the most &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; use of my time—not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that writing and composing and developing interesting software are not important. Rather: they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; good and valuable things. But they are things to focus on at other times in life. As fast as this life goes, and I am increasingly aware that it goes quickly indeed, I can expect in the ordinary course of things to have &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; years available for those things. I can exercise my gifts faithfully in the right time and season. Today, I can learn to love my little girls well, invest deeply in their lives, and savor moments that will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I must remind myself that teaching and shaping them is easily the most significant thing I will ever do. Should I write an essay that persuaded a thousand people to change their views on the arts, or to adopt a better view of the church, still my impact on two little lives would be more important. If I can point them faithfully to Christ and help them learn to walk faithfully with him as healthy members of his body, that will be a good life to have lived. Everything else is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icing is good, for the record. Sometimes, in these sorts of posts, we can mistake &lt;em&gt;relative importance&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;absolute importance&lt;/em&gt;. I should, at various times in my life, make sure to exercise the good gifts God has given me in ways appropriate to that time and context. Right now, that means continuing to write, but less frequently. In the future, it will mean something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this must stand in the context of resurrection hope. Too often, I live—too often, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; live—as though the next 60 years are all we may expect, the only time for writing and composing and so on. But it is not. I look forward to endless ages of creativity, exercising those gifts &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fully than I am able now. So: Lord Jesus, come soon. And in the meantime, may I be faithful in each season to do as well as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
