I cannot ignore the fact that I’m burnt out unless I want to make things worse. But I also recognize that with experiences like burnout, letting them dominate our mental lives can make things significantly worse, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fine little dance here: acknowledging the reality of the hard things we experience, while not narrowing our lives to &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; those hard things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of the way I try to walk this line in my own life: I am not holding myself to some of the exercise goals I set for myself before the worst of the burnout set in… but I am still exercising every day. That half marathon I wanted to run at the end of this month? I’m not running it. On too many runs in the last few weeks my body has simply shut down a few miles into a run. Two miles in, six miles in, three miles in… none of them are anything like 13.1 miles. So while I’ve managed a 14-mile run this training season, in the weeks since I did I have gotten loud, clear signals that continuing to push myself toward the race was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean I’m going to stop running, though. It means I’m going to be careful and wise about it. I’m going to listen to my body even more carefully when I’m out on a run than I normally do (and I’m not one of those people who keeps running when they shouldn’t anyway!). I’m going to switch some days over to doing Pilates with my wife instead of running. But also, on days like this past Saturday, when I felt &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; emotionally and wanted nothing more than to lay in bed… I got up and went for a 4-mile run. It helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: I won’t be dumb about my response to my burnout and pretend it doesn’t exist. But I also refuse to let especially the emotional experience of burnout be wholly determinative of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside, and a thing I will come back to in the future: you may have noticed that I have avoided writing of burnout as something external to me. This is intentional. Too often in our discussions of burnout, depression, or the like, we externalize them—a way of distancing ourselves from them, usually aimed at the same kinds of things I’ve gestured at in this little post. For reasons I’ll come back to, I don’t think that’s quite the right solution: burnout is not a foe outside myself to vanquish, but a set of emotional, physical, and spiritual things &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; myself. Again: more on that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aches and pains:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headaches: from low-level and relatively minor, to shooting pain in the temples or behind the eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backaches and neckaches: unrelieved (and unrelievable, no matter the Pilates routine) sensations of muscle tension, including everything from the lower back to the base of my skull—likely a partial cause of the low-level headaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stomachaches: so far, only when feeling exceptionally stressed, but regularly and often when feeling particularly stressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;occasional pains in my limbs unrelated to exercise I’ve done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fatigue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only sleep 7–7½ hours of sleep a night but now am needing 8½–9 hours to feel even somewhat rested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decreased ability while exercising: though I have kept exercising anyway, my general athletic performance is much degraded and on a semi-regular basis I’m unable to complete workouts normally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cynicism&lt;/strong&gt;: finding it difficult to think the best of decisions others make, even when I can explain them in rational and reasonable ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;severe demotivation:&lt;/strong&gt; having difficulty getting to work and through work; and having a hard time doing any of my normal side projects. The only hobby which has felt &lt;em&gt;doable&lt;/em&gt; for most of the last few months has been &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/making-things-helps.html" title="Making Things Helps"&gt;writing on and working on this website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crying, of all sorts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;streams of silent tears: not in the “I have something in my eye” sense but in the “I have tears streaming down my face” sense—but with no trigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quietly sobbing, with or without any trigger—but never triggers that would ordinarily prompt much of a reaction at all, much less crying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;outright weeping, to date only with a trigger—but again, with triggers of the sort that would normally just make me roll my eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anger:&lt;/strong&gt; seething frustration boiling over into white-hot rage or cold furies—not things I am prone to, and often over the smallest provocations from work. (Never from family! This is one of the clearest signals that I’m dealing with &lt;em&gt;burnout&lt;/em&gt;.) I carefully contain these, effectively practicing various ways of calming myself—especially prayer, recitation of Scripture, and singing hymns—and I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; allow myself to lash out at the people around me. It is nonetheless strange and disconcerting to have minor nuisances provoke such deep anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cravings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for sugary foods: occasionally sated with a good chocolate chip cookie, but more usually with a good piece of fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for alcohol: &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; set aside when I feel a “need” for it, lest it become a crutch or a means of self-medication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt;. Our bodies and minds tell us the story of the stresses we experience, whether we want to hear the story or not. (I’m listening clearly, and making lots of moves to deal with it. More on that in the weeks ahead.)&lt;/p&gt;
