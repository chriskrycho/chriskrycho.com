&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the airport this morning, I found that my attention itself had caught my attention. I have had &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/08/03/spectrum-of-attention/"&gt;this bit&lt;/a&gt; from L. M. Sacasas bouncing around in my head for the last month or so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to take photographs expands (and limits) the hiker‚Äôs perceptive repertoire‚Äîit creates new possibilities, the landscape now appears differently to our hiker. Smartphone in hand, the hiker might now perceive the world as field of possible images. This may, for example, direct attention up from the path toward the horizon, causing even our experienced hiker to stumble. We may be tempted to say, consequently, that the hiker is no longer paying attention, that the device has distracted him. But this is, at best, only partly true. The hiker is still paying attention. In fact, he may be paying very close, directed attention, hunting for that perfect image. But his attention is of a very different sort than the ‚Äúin the flow‚Äù attention of a hiker on the move. They are now missing some aspects of the surroundings, but picking up on others. Without the smartphone in hand, the hiker may not stumble, but they may not notice a particularly striking vista either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/photography-ing-again.html"&gt;Yesterday‚Äôs bit of history&lt;/a&gt; might give you to how I ended up walking through Denver International Airport with my camera in hand today, taking in the architecture with a rather different eye than I usually do. My normal path through the airport is &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; utilitarian: get to the gate, fill my water bottle, hit the bathroom, grab a seat and knock out some work while I wait to board. Today, though, I found myself considering the structures of the facility, its d√©cor, the little touches architectes and designers had put in place to (or at least, to attempt to) humanize what might otherwise be a terribly forbidding structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Airports are in some sense among the chief edifices of our modern, technological regime. They are not merely travel hubs, but miniature shopping malls. They require not only the massive infrastucture that supports aircraft themselves, but also the perhaps even greater infrastructure to support the cars we park there, the workers who cycle through, the food to be eaten, and so on. They are, I think, underappreciated as signifiers of our default approach of technological mastery over the world. More on this, perhaps, another day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very act of carrying a camera with me changed my perceptual relationship to the airport. And why? Because the device around my neck prompted (that is: my choice to carry it with me prompted) a shift in my attention. I left Sacasas‚Äô words above just as he wrote them, focused on the way a smartphone shifts the attention of his hypothetical hiker. The smartphone, by dint of its ubiquity and its versatility, does indeed (and &lt;em&gt;more especially&lt;/em&gt; than other devices) shift our attention. Not least, I think, because for most of us, there is no conscious choice to bring it with us, as there was for me with my camera this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone both draws our attention and diffuses it. For all that having the smartphone in my pocket may increase my attentiveness to the beautiful vista on a hike, it may also tempt me to disengage entirely from¬†the hike: not only to consider the environment in a different light, but to send my mind across the world to other places, other activities entirely. The contrast with a dedicated device like the camera I brought with me is illuminating. Certainly a camera shifts my relationship to a hike, just as it does to a stroll through the airport. But it does so by way of &lt;em&gt;focusing&lt;/em&gt; my attention, and drawing it into aspects of the hike that I might otherwise miss. That focusing is a tradeoff: as Sacasas notes, it means there are things I notice which I might not have had I not had a camera in hand; but also that there are aspects of a hike that I do not enjoy as I would had I no camera to hand‚Äîprecisely because my attention is focused by the device. But the difference between the way a single-purpose technology affects our attention and the way a device with greater versatility affects our attention is rather stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an increasing degree of affection for an interest in devices dedicated to a single job. Some of this is simply that, as good as smartphones are at many tasks, a purpose-built piece can often serve better than a jack-of-all-trades production. As my friend &lt;a href="https://www.stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; has often lamented: the iPod was a better portable music player‚Äîin the sense of doing that one specific job‚Äîthan any iPhone! I could say the same of my &lt;a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-aura-one-limited-edition"&gt;Kobo&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ and far more for a paper book! I find the experience of using those task-tailored technologies much more &lt;em&gt;enjoyable&lt;/em&gt; than our ubiquitous and flexible‚Äîand therefore ultimately &lt;em&gt;distracting&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîsmartphones. They shape my attention very differently, and (I think), &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been picking back up my long-dormant interest in photography. I started trying to learn how to take good photographs back during college‚Äîfirst with an inexpensive point-and-shoot with a decent built-in zoom lens, then with an inexpensive Canon &lt;abbr title="digital single lens reflex"&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; that was my college graduation present. I spent a decent amount of time on the hobby over those years, including doing some family and engagement photos for friends. (They were serviceable, not good; but I was learning a ton and it was a lot of fun‚Ä¶¬†and my friends didn‚Äôt have to pay for them.) I was just starting to develop a more serious interest in the technical aspects of the art‚Ä¶¬†when we moved to North Carolina and I started seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next five years, I took essentially zero photos with a camera not attached to my smartphone. It was not that I was no longer interested; it was that I simply could not keep up that hobby &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; everything else I was doing. I was doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;‚Äî&lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/burnout"&gt;probably too much.&lt;/a&gt; This summer, though, I found myself wanting to pick it back up in earnest. I was making good use of my phone camera, and I dug out my old &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; and bought new batteries for it and started taking it with me on a regular basis. I knew the old camera had some serious limitations, but I wanted to see if I enjoyed and was able to make good practice out of shooting with it anyway. No point in buying a new camera if I wasn‚Äôt actually enjoying using the old one, if the hobby didn‚Äôt stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stuck. This time, all the interest in technical aspects came back with a vengeance, so I have spent a not-inconsiderable amount of time wrapping my head around the physics of lenses. The limitations of the lenses I had for the old camera were very apparent every time I tried to take any kind of low-light shot, and its auto-focus performance was, well not bad for an inexpensive &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; from a decade ago‚Äîif you take my meaning. Having gotten a much better handle on the physics involved, though, I initially thought that I might be able to get away with just keeping the old camera and investing in good lenses for it. Unfortunately, as I started poking around, I concluded that I basically &lt;em&gt;couldn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; get some of the lenses I would want for it in the long term: wide primes with low ùëì numbers. Canon makes lenses in this bucket, but once you account for the &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-crop-factor"&gt;crop factor&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;abbr title="Advanced Photo System type-C"&gt;APS-C&lt;/abbr&gt; camera like my old &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt;, your options for actually wide lenses are pretty limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my time over the last few months has gone to reading‚Äîa &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîabout my options in the space. I discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/what-is-a-mirrorless-camera/"&gt;mirrorless&lt;/a&gt; revolution (most of a decade late), along with the dizzying array of lens options for full-frame cameras. Curious about how this worked in practice, I &lt;a href="https://share.lensrentals.com/x/tIxLHl" title="LensRentals"&gt;rented&lt;/a&gt; one of Sony‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-crop-factor"&gt;full-frame&lt;/a&gt; cameras for our family‚Äôs recent trip to North Carolina, and fell in love. (That‚Äôs an affiliate link for LensRentals: we both get $25 off a rental if you use it.) My own copy of the camera I had rented came this week, and I may have driven poor Jaimie slightly up the wall with all the pictures I‚Äôve been taking since.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I &lt;a href="https://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/art/category/photo/"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to include some photos in my blogging. I never got very far with it‚Äîin part because of the same lens limitations I ran into once I picked the hobby back up, but also because my old blog flow never really supported it well. (Sorry, 2012-era WordPress, but it‚Äôs true.) As I‚Äôm getting back into it, I want to find a way to make that flow work. This is yet another requirement for my much-delayed website redesign. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to have a solution I‚Äôm happy with in place by the time I ship (more on that soon, I hope!), but it‚Äôs something I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to get in place before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has me wishing there were better options for social sharing around photos. Indie blogging of the sort I so value is wonderful, but at the moment it doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to &lt;em&gt;interaction&lt;/em&gt; around items like photography. I have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of thoughts on things like &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention"&gt;Webmention&lt;/a&gt;, including how I plan to use it on my upcoming site redesign‚Ä¶ but those are for another day. For today: thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre curious: a &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1494679-REG/sony_ilce7rm4_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html"&gt;Sony Œ±7R IV&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs kind of ridiculously pricey‚Ä¶ but I expect to get at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; the next decade of shooting out of it, and the resolution is just bonkers, and the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of the thing is absolutely delightful to me. If I were making a recommendation for an entry into the Sony mirrorless space, I‚Äôd point you instead to the &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html"&gt;Sony Œ±7 III&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself a phenomenal camera, and I almost got it instead.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
