&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I have been picking back up my long-dormant interest in photography. I started trying to learn how to take good photographs back during college‚Äîfirst with an inexpensive point-and-shoot with a decent built-in zoom lens, then with an inexpensive Canon &lt;abbr title="digital single lens reflex"&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; that was my college graduation present. I spent a decent amount of time on the hobby over those years, including doing some family and engagement photos for friends. (They were serviceable, not good; but I was learning a ton and it was a lot of fun‚Ä¶¬†and my friends didn‚Äôt have to pay for them.) I was just starting to develop a more serious interest in the technical aspects of the art‚Ä¶¬†when we moved to North Carolina and I started seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next five years, I took essentially zero photos with a camera not attached to my smartphone. It was not that I was no longer interested; it was that I simply could not keep up that hobby &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; everything else I was doing. I was doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;‚Äî&lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/burnout"&gt;probably too much.&lt;/a&gt; This summer, though, I found myself wanting to pick it back up in earnest. I was making good use of my phone camera, and I dug out my old &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; and bought new batteries for it and started taking it with me on a regular basis. I knew the old camera had some serious limitations, but I wanted to see if I enjoyed and was able to make good practice out of shooting with it anyway. No point in buying a new camera if I wasn‚Äôt actually enjoying using the old one, if the hobby didn‚Äôt stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stuck. This time, all the interest in technical aspects came back with a vengeance, so I have spent a not-inconsiderable amount of time wrapping my head around the physics of lenses. The limitations of the lenses I had for the old camera were very apparent every time I tried to take any kind of low-light shot, and its auto-focus performance was, well not bad for an inexpensive &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt; from a decade ago‚Äîif you take my meaning. Having gotten a much better handle on the physics involved, though, I initially thought that I might be able to get away with just keeping the old camera and investing in good lenses for it. Unfortunately, as I started poking around, I concluded that I basically &lt;em&gt;couldn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; get some of the lenses I would want for it in the long term: wide primes with low ùëì numbers. Canon makes lenses in this bucket, but once you account for the &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-crop-factor"&gt;crop factor&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;abbr title="Advanced Photo System type-C"&gt;APS-C&lt;/abbr&gt; camera like my old &lt;abbr&gt;DSLR&lt;/abbr&gt;, your options for actually wide lenses are pretty limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my time over the last few months has gone to reading‚Äîa &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîabout my options in the space. I discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/what-is-a-mirrorless-camera/"&gt;mirrorless&lt;/a&gt; revolution (most of a decade late), along with the dizzying array of lens options for full-frame cameras. Curious about how this worked in practice, I &lt;a href="https://share.lensrentals.com/x/tIxLHl" title="LensRentals"&gt;rented&lt;/a&gt; one of Sony‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-crop-factor"&gt;full-frame&lt;/a&gt; cameras for our family‚Äôs recent trip to North Carolina, and fell in love. (That‚Äôs an affiliate link for LensRentals: we both get $25 off a rental if you use it.) My own copy of the camera I had rented came this week, and I may have driven poor Jaimie slightly up the wall with all the pictures I‚Äôve been taking since.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I &lt;a href="https://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com/art/category/photo/"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to include some photos in my blogging. I never got very far with it‚Äîin part because of the same lens limitations I ran into once I picked the hobby back up, but also because my old blog flow never really supported it well. (Sorry, 2012-era WordPress, but it‚Äôs true.) As I‚Äôm getting back into it, I want to find a way to make that flow work. This is yet another requirement for my much-delayed website redesign. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to have a solution I‚Äôm happy with in place by the time I ship (more on that soon, I hope!), but it‚Äôs something I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to get in place before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has me wishing there were better options for social sharing around photos. Indie blogging of the sort I so value is wonderful, but at the moment it doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to &lt;em&gt;interaction&lt;/em&gt; around items like photography. I have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of thoughts on things like &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention"&gt;Webmention&lt;/a&gt;, including how I plan to use it on my upcoming site redesign‚Ä¶ but those are for another day. For today: thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre curious: a &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1494679-REG/sony_ilce7rm4_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html"&gt;Sony Œ±7R IV&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs kind of ridiculously pricey‚Ä¶ but I expect to get at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; the next decade of shooting out of it, and the resolution is just bonkers, and the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; of the thing is absolutely delightful to me. If I were making a recommendation for an entry into the Sony mirrorless space, I‚Äôd point you instead to the &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html"&gt;Sony Œ±7 III&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself a phenomenal camera, and I almost got it instead.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
