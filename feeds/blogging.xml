&lt;p&gt;Trying to just work through that series in chronological order of publication is &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt;—not quite &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt;—impossible. Never mind that the series is a &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt;, and that most posts build on earlier posts, Medium wants to &lt;em&gt;foster engagement&lt;/em&gt; and tell you what other people have read most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It keeps up this nonsense even when you pull the the Archive view: it displays the top 10 posts from 2017, sorted by which ones people read most. There’s no view of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the posts in the series, simply sorted by date, period. You can sort those top 10 posts by date, but to get to the series in chronological sequence, you have to click into each month… and then click the button &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; to sort by date &lt;em&gt;for every single month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This absurd focus on algorithmic sorting is an abomination—a desecration of all that is good and noble and beautiful about the format of the blog. It should die an ignominious death, unmourned by anyone but Silicon Valley venture capitalists thinking to make a quick buck on other people’s publishing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

I reread my own blog posts fairly regularly. It’s not vanity—not some weird obsession with my own awesomeness in the form of my own writing or some such nonsense. It’s that in my blog posts over the last decade, I have a pretty serious backlog of &lt;em&gt;what I was thinking about at any given point in time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exhaustive, by a long shot. It only includes things I actually decided to publish.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There are, sadly, not many short thoughts in the mix. Nor is it well-tagged or organized in any internally-consistent way—even in any single version of the site, much less across versions. But nonetheless the history is still there, and I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; traverse the various lines through it, such as they are. (Sometimes, even, the changes in organization and structure are illuminating about how I was thinking about things at the time!) In any case, my habit of linking to previous references to ideas has proven invaluable for the times when I want to trawl back through old posts and consider those old thoughts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading old blog posts is a strange experience, of course. The person who wrote these things was recognizably myself; but I am not who I then I was, and I sometimes disagree with myself on the substance and often on the style. (I occasionally find an old gem and wonder how I ever managed to write so well.) That very strangeness, it turns out, is why I do this every so often, though. Thinking well is often a matter of forging connections between ideas that were previously not connected for us. We cannot consciously hold in our minds even a fraction of all the things we have thought about or even written something about over the years. We can, however, jog our memories, and let new connections form. And rereading one’s own blog post is a great way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d not heard specifically of the &lt;a href="https://zettelkasten.de"&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt; until Alan Jacobs linked it a while back, but it fits this model pretty perfectly, and maps as well to ways I’ve been &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to structure my note-taking and thinking for the past few years. (I’m going to be consciously doing more of this in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, my current notes app of choice. I’ll probably write up my experience that way once I’ve actually had some experience!) But this also ties into some of the things Jacobs has been &lt;a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-blog-garden/" title="The Blog Garden"&gt;musing out loud&lt;/a&gt; about in his own blog over the last week. It’s not just that a blog can serve as a place to do some of the fleshing-out of ideas. It’s not just that a blog can be a record of the development of ideas. It can also serve to jog new ideas if you read yourself again, displaced (both literally and temporally) from the original writing of the thing. A blog is kind of like a public notebook, and while it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be useful for others to browse through it, is &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; useful for me to browse back through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though: if you look at the archives, especially including those on my &lt;a href="http://blog.chriskrycho.com" title="Thoughts; A Flame"&gt;first real blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://2012-2013.chriskrycho.com"&gt;the previous iteration of this site&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll notice that I published a lot of posts about a lot of subjects, whether my thoughts were especially well-formed or not.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that I’m always reflecting on the shape I want my internet presence to take. Over the last month, in particular, I’ve been thinking about the kind of “link-blogging” and commentary-on-articles-I’ve-read that I’ve experimented with pushing into Pinboard for the last &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/pick-the-right-tool-for-the-job.html"&gt;year and some change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I’ve found that Pinboard is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; for two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having an easy place to look up articles I’ve read but can’t necessarily remember the name of off the top of my head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; place with its own &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt; feed of that content, which is social-network-like in some ways but using open web tech like &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it isn’t is &lt;em&gt;integrated with my own site&lt;/em&gt;, or particularly easily discoverable &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; my site. Adding a link to my public Pinboard feed would help, perhaps, but you wouldn’t know what I use it &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; from seeing that link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I want this material here on this site. There remain two blockers to me there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ease of publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;site design and structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I am happy enough with a static site generator setup. However, for this specific kind of use, I wish for a web front-end to my website (or, honestly, an easy way to integrate &lt;a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; with it). The options which exist in that general space—WordPress and Ghost—both have their upsides, but also a great many downsides, and I find that I have no interest in using either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might find that an odd commitment; here’s an aside on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://krycho.com"&gt;family blog&lt;/a&gt; is a Ghost install, and the previous iteration of this site ran on WordPress. Ghost is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, and for many setups it’s actually really good. For my fairly complex set of publishing requirements, it unfortunately doesn’t really do the trick. Some of those requirements (like integration with citation-management tooling) are &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; less pressing, but I don’t count on that being the case in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, one possible alternative here is simply to cross that bridge if or when I come to it and lean on the somewhat simpler tools that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; meet my needs for today. If I did that, it would certainly be with Ghost, because WordPress feels to me the same way Windows feels to me: technically very competent, but impossibly frustrating to use. (That’s not insulting either of the two; it’s a statement of my very—overly, perhaps!—specific aesthetic tastes and my corresponding—admittedly irrational!—response to the experience of using Windows or WordPress. Maybe it’s just the ‘W’s that start the names?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one reason I’ve seriously considered figuring out how to make my &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;long-on-hold site generator&lt;/a&gt; actually be a hybrid: never dynamically generating content, but with an &lt;abbr&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; to enable programmatic access, so that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; put a web or app front end on it. (Existing solutions in that space, like &lt;a href="https://www.netlifycms.org"&gt;Netlify CMS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://forestry.io/"&gt;forestry.io&lt;/a&gt;, are really good, but don’t quite support everything I have historically committed to needing. They also don’t have anything like an iOS share sheet!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that I’m not yet ready to spend my limited time building out my long-planned and long-delayed personal website generator tool. In short, I’m caught in a catch-22 of my own making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I want to figure out a flow for sharing those kinds of notes-on-articles that works better for getting it onto my blog, rather than caught in the mostly-invisible space that is my Pinboard. I need a refreshed site design to support it effectively. I need different &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; to support that flow effectively. Which means I’m not going to end up doing it tomorrow or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll get to it eventually. Maybe. Hopefully. And in the meantime I’ll do one extra step when I see something worth linking, and copy it into a Ulysses document that I can publish shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where every nerd ends up with their blogging software, I think: in a pit of good-enough-to-get-by but not-actually-satisfying. (But I’m not helping myself with how persnickety I am about these things.)&lt;/p&gt;
