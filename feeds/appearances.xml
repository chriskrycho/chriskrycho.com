I was there officially to talk about TypeScript, and I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of that… but we also dug into Rust a bit, of course, as well as talking about my schedule and “productivity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been podcasting for a few years now, but this was only the second time I’ve ever been on someone &lt;em&gt;else’s&lt;/em&gt; podcast—and it was a blast. Thanks so much to Adam for having me on!&lt;/p&gt;
