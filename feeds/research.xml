&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been slowly mulling on a number of things over the last few weeks, it became increasingly clear to me that I needed to invest a bit more in my research system. I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/how-do-you-manage-your-research-notes.html"&gt;asked before&lt;/a&gt; how people manage their own research, and I’ve noted how &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/blog-as-note-taking-tool.html"&gt;I use my blog as a note-taking tool of sorts&lt;/a&gt;. As I’ve started digging into a couple larger problems—one of which is likely going to take me a decade of work—I’ve come back to this question, and I find that I still don’t have great answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like the &lt;a href="https://zettelkasten.de"&gt;Zettelkasten approach&lt;/a&gt; seems like it probably does what I need it to. So this week I’ve started organizing notes in &lt;a href="https://bear.app"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; that way. I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; taking the tack sometimes advocated of intentionally having no hierarchy whatsoever for my notes, though I’m eschewing any particularly deep hierarchies. I consistently find that I need some kind of project or “notebook” level of organization when I’m digging deep on something, and it’s always nice to hear that I’m not alone in that. &lt;a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/my-zettelkasten/"&gt;Alan Jacobs, on the same topic:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I thought, why not have a collection of Zettel that is based not on a lifetime of research but on a single project? So I tried that. And it worked wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Jacobs, the notecard system doesn’t work for me. I enjoy writing notes by hand, but in a lot of cases I’m writing down code snippets, which is very hard to do on notecards unless the code snippets are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; brief. Instead, I’m so far making heavy use of Bear’s ability to &lt;a href="https://bear.app/faq/Tags%20&amp;amp;%20Linking/How%20to%20link%20notes%20together/"&gt;link between notes&lt;/a&gt;, and even heavier use of Bear’s &lt;a href="https://bear.app/faq/Tags%20&amp;amp;%20Linking/Nested%20Tags/"&gt;tagging system&lt;/a&gt; for adding keywords to notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with my comment about hierarchy, though, I’m only allowing myself one level of hierarchy: the “project” or “notebook.” Everything in that “notebook” is a single keyword/tag deep, structured like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;notebook&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;keyword&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;—never &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;notebook&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;keyword&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;another keyword.&lt;/code&gt;. I am also freely including tags across these “notebooks”: something might be in &lt;code&gt;A/q&lt;/code&gt; and also &lt;code&gt;C/z&lt;/code&gt;. That gives me the best of both worlds: project-level organization, but also the ability to see associations that play out beyond an individual project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how this plays out, but so far I’m liking it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusingly, it’s forcing me to clean up my existing set of notes in Bear: things tagged “writing/ideas” are now getting pushed over into a corresponding bucket in &lt;a href="https://ulysses.app"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;, which is my preferred application for actually &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;. Miscellaneous/non-project notes are currently going in a top level “notebook”—a top level tag in Bear—called &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; (for Zettelkasten). Under it I have things like &lt;code&gt;z/pedagogy&lt;/code&gt;, but once again, I’m intentionally allowing myself only one level of nesting here. I am still &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/just-write-down-what-you-do.html"&gt;logging my work&lt;/a&gt; in a work tag. And I also have notebooks for things like food, gift ideas, etc., since Bear is currently my go-to notes app. (This is part of what forced me to the project/notebook mentality in the first place: having dozens of top-level tags in that sidebar was just going to break my brain.) But hopefully having all these notes around and in a just-structured-&lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; form will be useful as I work on these larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll report more as I keep going with this!&lt;/p&gt;
