The same page, for example (287), includes both of these quotes—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rejecting mere traditionalism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This [Paul’s example of self-sacrifice for evangelism] means that in our evangelistic methodology, and indeed in our worship (for that also has an evangelistic element, [1 Corinthians] 14:24–25), our goal must not be to please ourselves, but to bend and stretch, toa ccept discomfort and the trauma of change, in order to speak the Christian faith to the contemporary world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Fathers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had much more time to study Scripture than did the early church fathers like Clement and Justin Martyr. And in some ways, I think, contemporary orthodox Reformed theology has a far deeper and more precise understanding of the gospel than did the church fathers. I say this contrary to those evangelicals who are joining Eastern Orthodox churches in order to return to the supposedly more profound teachings of the early church fathers. Although the Fathers did wonderful work in their day, standing heroically for the faith amid terrible oppressions, their writings were confused on many important points, such as the Trinity and justification by faith. (287)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quote is an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; summary of the Christian obligation to continually reapply the testimony of Scripture to the present. The book is full of these kinds of enormously helpful bits; I have written far more ✓ than ✗ marks—i.e., many more affirmations than rejections—in this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that second quote makes me want to bang my head against the desk. When Frame waves his hand at “the Fathers” and declares “their writings” “confused on… the Trinity and justification by faith,” I am left saying: &lt;em&gt;Which Fathers?&lt;/em&gt; and, even more importantly, &lt;em&gt;Frame, where do you think we &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; our doctrine of the Trinity, if not the Fathers?&lt;/em&gt; To be sure, there is plenty of variation in quality and reliability of the Fathers. Origen is a brilliant, fascinating hot mess of a theologian, for example, while Irenaeus, Hillary, Augustine, Athanasius, and others are no less sure or reliable than any major Reformed author. Moreover: reading early Reformed writers makes it very clear that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; thought the Fathers broadly reliable and helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every author has strengths and weaknesses. Even the most helpful require &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Behe has suggested that many structures found in biological systems are &lt;em&gt;irreducibly complex&lt;/em&gt;, that is, complex in such a way that they could not have arisen via indirect, chance development but bear clear evidence of having been designed. This evidence of design comes from the fact that these systems have a number of parts without which the mechanism in question simply does not function—not with degraded or partial function, but no function at all. He offers up several prominent examples of this phenomena, among them the human eye and the bacterial flagellum. With each, he shows how problematic a materialist evolutionary account for their development must be, charting six steps in “design space” which any such account must fulfill. Take the human eye: (1) Development begins with a light-sensitive spot. (2) All steps which finally result in a human eye occur via heritable genetic variation. (3) At no point does a designer intervene; all steps occur solely by random mutation. (4) Each step along the way must be either adaptive, conferring greater survivability and reproductive success on the organism, or at least not maladaptive, making the organism less likely to survive. (5) No step may be exceptionally improbable relative to the others in the sequence. (6) The final step in the sequence must be the actual, functioning human eye. Behe argues variously that such a naturalistic evolutionary path is either impossible or at least incredibly improbable for many biological systems. As such, he thinks he has evidence or proof that the systems did not develop (and perhaps could not have been developed) via purely naturalistic means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several major lines of criticism have been advanced against Behe’s argument, notably by Paul Draper. Draper first notes that while Behe establishes a challenge for evolutionary explanations of these biological, he by no means proves them irreducibly complex. Asserting that they are is not &lt;em&gt;proving&lt;/em&gt; that they are. Second, and closely related, many evolutionary biologists deny that these systems, complex as they are, are &lt;em&gt;irreducibly&lt;/em&gt; complex. A number of potential explanations have been offered for how the systems Behe describes might have developed in a way that satisfies his criteria. Third, he notes that Behe struggles to define clearly what constitutes a “part” in such systems. But since a “part” is an integral element of his scheme of irreducible complexity, it seems a definition should be forthcoming. Finally, Draper suggests that there are evolutionary phenomena capable of explaining the phenomena Behe outlines. If an element S has a function F at time T, and later at time T ʹ develops into S ʹ, which at time Tʹʹ is integrated into a larger system Q which confers functionality Fʹ, then Sʹ is not an irreducibly complex part of Fʹ. It arose independently, even though it was incorporated into the later function Fʹ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial rejoinder to Draper is in order. Though he is right to note that Behe has not proven these structures to be irreducibly complex, neither have evolutionary biologists offered any actual path through the design space as hard evidence against Behe. Granted that it may not be possible for them to do so; still, telling a just-so story does not constitute a particularly strong claim. Moreover, that such a story can be told in no way makes it probable. This might defeat Behe’s stronger claim (irreducibly complex structures &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; arise by purely natural evolutionary means), but not the weaker form (it is extremely &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that irreducibly complex structures could arise by purely natural evolutionary means). Draper’s points do weaken Behe’s case, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvin Plantinga offers two further criticisms. First, assume Behe is right and that these developments are extraordinarily improbable. So what? Many extraordinarily improbable things have happened. If humans &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; inhabit a materialist universe in which no intelligent designer exists, then this extraordinarily improbable thing is precisely what happened. Second, and perhaps more serious—not only for Behe but for other Intelligent Design theorists, such as William Dembski—the prior probabilities of these outcomes are simply unknowable. One might devise some set of numbers in an attempt to represent the problem space, but such an attempt would always be fundamentally just guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative option, Plantinga suggests that Behe’s approach be taken not as an inductive argument for these systems’ being designed, but as a sort of &lt;em&gt;design discourse&lt;/em&gt;. That is, Behe’s points are not something like an inference to the best explanation; rather, they are a normal, rational part of human cognition, and as such may be well-warranted even if a sustained argument for them cannot be mounted. Plantinga notes that many rational beliefs cannot be argued: the reliability of one’s senses, or memories, or the existence of other minds. The existence of other minds is particularly relevant, because when an explorer finds something and attributes design to it, that is just what she is doing: attributing the existence of some artifact to another mind. Such behavior is clearly rational in many situations: if astronauts on the moon discover a very large obsidian monolith, they are not obliged to chalk it up to some purely mechanistic and hitherto unknown lunar process. They immediately, and &lt;em&gt;rightly&lt;/em&gt; attribute it to another intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behe’s discussion seems to be just along these lines. When humans look at complex biological systems, they give every appearance of having been designed—and not only to the theists who would presumably have a bias in that direction. This appearance of design has led eminent atheists to offer up any number of comments explaining away that appearance, Sir Francis Crick and Richard Dawkins both famously among them. When atheist writers are wont to say things like “Biology is the study of things which appear to have been designed, but were not,” they strongly suggest that Plantinga’s reading of Behe may be on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beliefs formed basically are not, of course, unassailable. A person suffering from amnesia might come to distrust her memories. If someone is informed he is under the influence of a hallucinogen, he would have reason to doubt his observations of the world. Basic beliefs can be defeated by being undercut, or by being flat-out rebutted. In the case of a design discourse, for example, the belief could be totally rebutted if one could offer proof that natural, totally unguided evolution &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; produced one of these biological systems. This, however, is impossible: science itself is incapable of showing that the evolutionary process was not directed by God. Even if the mutations that led to the development of the system were totally random, they could nonetheless have been planned by God in the creation of the whole universe from the beginning. Such a claim is therefore inherently metaphysical, and cannot be demonstrated empirically. It would be easier to undercut the design belief, by showing it both possible and not &lt;em&gt;profoundly&lt;/em&gt; unlikely that an evolutionary path could have given rise to the phenomena in question. If such a path could be shown, it would indeed serve to weaken one’s confidence in a design assessment. For one thing, though, such paths do seem to be rather improbable (even if the actual probabilities are not knowable). For another, even if such an undercutting defeater were granted entirely, it might not totally defeat the basic belief, because there can be &lt;em&gt;deflectors&lt;/em&gt; for such defeaters. If one has many other reasons (philosophical, empirical, experiential, and so on) to affirm Christianity, for example, then even a reasonable claim for the viability of some naturalist evolutionary path might not &lt;em&gt;defeat&lt;/em&gt; the design assessment—only weaken it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Behe’s analysis &lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; argument has a number of weaknesses. It may serve as one part of a broader inference toward theism, but on its own merits, it does seem to fall prey to some of the critiques Draper in particular offers—not least, because Behe advances a very strong claim about the irreducible complexity of the structures in question. It falls to him to defend that claim. But taking his analysis as exemplary of a basic, and therefore well-warranted, &lt;em&gt;recognition&lt;/em&gt; of design in biological systems seem rather more secure. Taking the two together may be the best of all. It may be possible to see and immediately recognize design, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to reason inferentially about designed mechanisms, and for both to have a confirmatory status in one’s affirmation of Christian theism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fine-tuning argument notes that human existence in the universe depends on a wide array of natural constants existing within very narrow ranges, and that it does not seem that those constants &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; had to be within those ranges, and infers from these two observations that the universe has been fine-tuned for the existence of human life. For example, the balance between the strong and weak nuclear forces is just such that matter forms, and not only matter but the wide variety of light and heavy elements found throughout the universe (not just something like hydrogen). The strength of the gravitational constant is just such that the universe neither inflated so rapidly that no stars could form, nor so slowly that it collapsed back in on itself under the influence of its own mass, during the Big Bang at its origin. The electromagnetic force is of just the right strength so that electrons are bound to their molecules, but not so tightly that they cannot be exchanged between particles, with all the extraordinary effects on exchange of energy that enables in a wide variety of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many more examples could be multiplied; the point is that if any of these or many other factors were only very slightly different, the universe would not exist as we know it, and nothing remotely like human life could exist at all. Moreover, there seem to be very many (possibly infinite) other possible values for these constants. There is no apparent reason the gravitational field &lt;em&gt;could not&lt;/em&gt; be twice as strong or a third as strong as it is, for example. So the universe seems to have been designed—its basic “settings” fine-tuned—to be a place inhabitable by creatures like human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the stronger and more common arguments advanced against the fine-tuning hypothesis are the anthropic principle, and the many worlds hypothesis. Proponents of the anthropic principle as an explanation of the fine-tuning note that the only way anyone &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; exist to observe the universe is if it had these constants. Since people are here and do observe the universe, it is unsurprising that the universe has these constants. On the one hand, this seems patently obvious: of course the only kind of universe which could be observed by creatures like humans is one suitable for them to live in. On the other hand, it seems to miss the point entirely. If a firing squad of a dozen crack marksman line up to carry out an execution, all with live ammunition, all at close range, and after they all fire the person to be executed still lives, it does not serve as an explanation to him to say, “Well, obviously you could only be here to talk with us about this if you lived; if you had died you wouldn’t be here.” The improbability of surviving such an event demands explanation. So, too, the improbability of the one universe that exists having these properties demands explanation. After all, its existence does not &lt;em&gt;depend&lt;/em&gt; on the people observing it (not least since there were no people around to observe it for most of its very long history). These factors exist entirely independent of the observers, and as such the fine-tuning argument is well-warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong form of the argument might take into account the problems that come from observation selection effect. If one noted that all amoebas which have ever been observed were within an inch of a microscope, and then inferred that therefore all amoebas which &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt; are within an inch of a microscope, this would be a bad observer selection inference. The limitations of the observation prejudice the availability of the data. Likewise, if one had a net which was capable of catching only ten-inch-long or larger fish, and inferred from catching only ten-inch-long or larger first that there were not smaller fish in the pond, the inference would be a bad one. However, the fine-tuning argument is not like this. Rather, it is more like an argument which says: (1) Offspring are usually fairly like their parents. (2) This fish is just over ten-inches long. (H3) The fish might have parents which are only one inch long each. (H4) The fish might have parents which are nine to eleven inches long. (5) Observation 2 is much more likely on H4 than on H3 given Observation 1. Therefore (6) this fish’s parents were probably nine to eleven inches long. This argument might be wrong, but it is nothing like the earlier, obviously silly examples. The fine-tuning argument is of the same basic form: (1) The physical constants of the universe could have had any of a very wide, possibly infinite array of values. (2) The universe’s physical constants are just such that life is possible. (H3) The universe was created by God. (H4) The universe arose by chance. (5) Observation 2 is much likelier on H3 than on H4 given Observation 1. Therefore, more probably the universe was created by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the severe problems with the argument from the anthropic principle, some atheists have instead advanced a many-worlds hypothesis. In this view, there are many universes—trillions, perhaps an infinite number. Universes constantly bubble into existence from the quantum foam, expanding with their own randomly chosen variations on the constants. Given such a plethora of universes, it is no longer improbable that a universe such as this one exists; in fact, its seems &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; probable. There are several serious problems with this idea, however. The first is that while it may make more probable the existence of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; universe with a given set of constants, it does not make more probable the fine-tuning of any specific universe. The same basic problem faced by the anthropic principle explanation therefore still applies: out of all the universes out there, why is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; one well-tuned for existence? Turning the earlier example slightly: imagine that an execution would be stayed only if every die in a set of 20 20-sided dice came up with a one. If an execution &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; stayed on that basis, the event would not be explained by the existence of many worlds such that it is likely that such a thing would happen in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; world. It would still seem (and be!) a miraculous survival. Second, and more seriously, the many-worlds hypothesis introduces an infinite regress, but of something which is not apparently &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;: the universe. But if the problem is to be solved by introducing either infinite regress, or by treating something as necessary, the multiplication of worlds seems to radically reduce simplicity relative to the idea that God exists. Moreover, incidentally, on the Christian God’s existence it seems far more probable that universes would be fine-tuned for life even on the many-worlds hypothesis, for the Christian God is interested in knowing and being known by creatures; no such constraint is operative in a non-theistic many-worlds scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these arguments against the fine-tuning argument is very telling. Both are very nearly question-begging, in fact, and in each case it still looks far more likely that the universe is fine-tuned because someone wanted it to support life, than that it just happened that way by chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a common-place of some older philosophy of science and religion to suppose that the universe described by Newton’s laws of mechanics, Maxwell’s equations, and so on was a place of such regularity that there was no room for miracles. Because the laws posited deterministic systems in which the outcome of any given system could be known &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, given the total set of antecedent conditions, some philosophers took the system to be indicating that determinism was a fact of the universe. Divine intervention would then be ruled out: God interacting with the universe would break Newton’s laws of mechanics and Maxwell’s laws of electromagnetism, and scientific laws more generally. Antithetical though this stance might seem to be to the Christian faith, a number of prominent philosophers and theologians, including such high-profile figures as Mackie and Bultmann, have affirmed this premise and integrated it into their theologizing. They were willing to affirm the “C phenomena”—God’s &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;conserving&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;concurring&lt;/em&gt; work in the world—but not the “M phenomena” of &lt;em&gt;miracles&lt;/em&gt;, God intervening directly in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most obvious problem with the idea that the scientific laws in question would be violated by a divine special intervention is that the laws themselves specify that they hold for closed systems. Newton’s laws of mechanics, for example, require conservation of mass and energy within a system—as long as, and only as long as, there is no external input into the system. If an external force does act on a system, then momentum (e.g.) is not conserved. Likewise, Maxwell’s formulations describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields in a closed system. God intervening, however, would by definition mean the system is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; closed. It is not that God would be violating the laws. Rather, the laws describe a different situation from the one in which God acts specially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theologians such as Mackie and Bultmann who rejected miracles as “mythologizing” and out of bounds did not deny that God interacted with the world in any way, only that he did not interact &lt;em&gt;specially&lt;/em&gt; with it. Unfortunately, the arguments they raise against God’s acting specially in the world argue against God’s acting in the world at all. Their argument runs something like this: if the state of the world is known at time T, and these laws hold, then the state of the world at time T* can be known as well. But if God specially intervenes, if he engages in a miracle, then this is no longer so. That would be violating the laws, and so he does not (perhaps cannot, if he wishes to uphold his world) perform miracles. However, precisely the same is true of those “C-phenomena.” If God had not created the world, obviously the world would not exist and nothing would occur. If he does not conserve the world so it continues to exist, then no matter what was known about the state of the world at time T, nothing whatsoever can be said of it (even that it still exists) at time T*. If he does not continue to concur with the function of the world he has designed, so that the laws he designed remain in force, then chaos follows. Whatever was so at T is in no way related to what happens at time T* if God is not upholding the causal powers of everything in the universe. Miracles, then, are not &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; in this way. Their specialness is in their distinction from the way God ordinarily conducts himself in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might here by objected that this leaves the theist with no way to distinguish between miraculous and ordinary events: both are simply the outcome of God’s will. This is patently false. On this objection, no one could ever identify any rare event, nor claim that something had happened which had never happened before. Nor could science develop; it is precisely identifying outlying phenomena and ways things differ from human expectations and current predictions about the world which drives scientific exploration. If indeed God conserves and concurs with the universe in a pattern he ordained, then the times when he acts unusually—out of step with the normal—will look quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One further objection might be raised, about the inconsistency of God’s acting specially in the world at all. Why, the skeptic about miracles might ask, would God &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to act in the world in these ways—should he not be able to set everything up ahead of time so that things fall out without his intervention. This has an apparent simplicity in its favor. It seems, though, that it assumes a particular view of the desires of God—for a basically mechanical system in which he will never need to intervene. If instead God desires to be known by some of the creatures in his world, it seems the opposite is true. Establishing an orderly world will not only make it habitable for those creatures, and will not only allow them to flourish and succeed therein; it will allow him to reveal himself to them &lt;em&gt;by way of miracles&lt;/em&gt;. If the world were chaotic, no event would seem strange. If he never intervened, he would be difficult or impossible to know. Precisely because he creates an orderly world and both conserves it in being and concurs with the causal powers with which he initially endued it, the times when he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; act distinctively are revelatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, any discussion of God “breaking” or “violating” the laws of nature seems entirely wrong. The laws simply do not apply to those conditions. They describe what happens in the case when the world proceeds in the ordinary way, precisely because of God’s creating, conserving, and concurring with the world. But God is not constrained by them; the regularities exist because he desires them to! He is free to act in different ways when it suits his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part I: Argument for Realism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction-definition-constraints" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Introduction, Definition, Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these facts… are so striking, because there was no reason &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; to expect man to be able to achieve such cognitive feats, because no undertaking can guarantee success &lt;em&gt;of this particular sort&lt;/em&gt;, we are confronted with a genuine problem: why is science so successful?&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of science over the last four hundred years has produced a radical increase in effective prediction of natural phenomena across a wide array of domains. It has also yielded a striking ability to intervene successfully in the natural world in areas as diverse as biology and medicine on the one hand, and particle physics and the development of computing technology on the other. Yet, when scientists speak of electrons, quarks, dark matter, and so on—phenomena not directly accessible to ordinary human experience, but in many cases directly related to this empirical and technological success—it is an open question in philosophy of science whether such entities really exist, or are merely useful ways of solving problems and dealing with data. Scientific realism is the affirmation that the entities postulated by scientific theories actually do exist. This claim does not entail the success of all scientific theories, and is therefore not compromised by the failure and replacement of some scientific theories. Nor does it require that all theories be embraced equally firmly. It simply means the claims and practice of science do really, if only approximately, describe the world. This paper will argue that critical realism is the best explanation for science’s success, and that it correctly characterizes the relationship between scientific models and the world they describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="reasons-for-accepting-realism" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Reasons for Accepting Realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-analogical-reasoning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;a. Analogical Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most straightforward arguments in favor of scientific realism is the intuition toward realism in general. When a detective examines a murder scene, she tends to assume the hypothesized criminal actually exists. Further analysis may or may not bear out the initial hypothesis about who committed a crime—perhaps it was a psychotic killer escaped from a mental ward, not an acquaintance of the deceased—but her normal faculties reliably point toward real entities in the world. Moreover, the process of analysis generally leads an (honest) investigator toward an increasingly accurate mental picture of the perpetrator. Missteps may occur in the analysis, but are amenable to critical reassessment, so that even when the revision from the original hypothesis is substantial, the trend-line of the mental model is toward increasing accuracy. The basic picture was refined, not destroyed: the victim was not after all killed by a wizard from Alpha Centauri (and even that would be a malicious, person-like agent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, on a realist view, operates similarly. Initial hypotheses may prove to have more or less in common with the real world, and not only may but &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be subject to revision, even radical revision along the way. However, theories should be treated realistically, both ontologically (there really is something out there to know) and epistemically (science grants access to reality, albeit in approximate and limited fashion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary argument against this analogy toward scientific realism is the idea of in-principle unobservables.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The crime scene investigator has direct experience of things like criminals (other human persons, at least) as well as of the evidence itself. No one has direct experience of electrons. More than this, the postulates of quantum mechanics (are taken to) suggest that no one &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have such direct experience. Then, the antirealist argues, the scientific claim is at best unknowable: electrons may exist, but scientists have no way of knowing. They may observe a trail in a gas cloud, but whether the thing leaving the trail is really like an electron is unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any such attempt to distinguish in principle between observables and unobservables fails.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, antirealists use “unobservable” to mean anything not directly observable by human senses. However, declaring such objects in-principle unobservable is question-begging: the point under debate is just whether things detected indirectly are being observed or simply hypothesized. Antirealists must first establish such an in-principle distinction between indirect and direct observation. Realists note that indirect observation is rightly considered reliable in the realm of ordinary experience, and can rationally be extended analogically. It is reasonable to conclude that the wind is blowing from seeing its effects on trees even if sitting inside a closed room (with no direct experience of the wind). This would be so even for a person who had spent his entire life locked up inside and therefore had never had direct experiential access to wind or trees. Indirect observations still count as observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-whole-cloth-reasoning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;b. Whole-Cloth Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, human reasoning seems to be “whole cloth.” It is difficult (if not impossible) to find any particular line, even a blurry one, where this kind of inferential reasoning becomes suspect.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Granted that electrons are quite different from anything of which humans have direct experience, this is not finally telling against reasoning about them. Humans are quite capable of making the requisite fine distinctions required for analogical reasoning to be valid; indeed, scientific models of electrons expressly include both similarities to and sharp discontinuities with human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a realist view rightly makes sense of the way “observability” lies along a spectrum. On one end are those phenomena which can be detected through (normal, healthy) human senses such as hearing or vision. Moving down toward the not-directly-observable spectrum, scientists use telescopes and microscopes to enhance their ability to observe things inaccessible to ordinary human sight because of distance and size respectively. In both cases, however, there is no clear line distinguishing “observable” from “unobservable”—only a spectrum of more- or less-&lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt;-observable phenomena. Insects may be observed with the unaided human eye, bacteria with optical microscopes, individual molecules of materials with electron microscopes. In each case, the same principle is at work in the observation: light bouncing off an object and being received.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-realist may object: the fact that the distinction between observables and unobservables is blurry does not mean it does not exist. As Samir Okasha notes, the line between “bald” and “hirsute” may be fuzzy (pun intended), but it is still possible to identify a bald man.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even granting the in-principle distinction between “observable” and “unobservable,” however, the objection fails to establish the strong claim made by antirealists. It does not establish that the items in question are in fact unobservable (especially when confronted with the realist argument for indirect observation). Nor does it establish that scientists would be in principle incapable of correctly modeling unobservables. At most, it establishes that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be unobservable phenomena.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that though current models of astronomical behavior, or of quantum mechanics, or gravity, or any other only-indirectly-observable phenomena may be incomplete or partial, they nonetheless represent something &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;. There really is an electron leaving a trail in the gas chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="c.-no-miracles" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;c. No Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substantial success of science in both predicting and providing coherent explanations for empirical phenomena, it seems &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; strange that the hypotheses in question would have nothing whatsoever to do with reality. It would be a miracle of sorts if a set of theories which do not directly rely on each other would all work effectively, and effectively &lt;em&gt;in conjunction&lt;/em&gt;, while not actually saying anything true about the world. These predictions are more than merely theoretically interesting; they have real-world application used every day: “laser technology is based on a theory about what happens when electrons in an atom go from higher to lower energy-states. And lasers work…”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It seems reasonable that one reason scientific theories have been so successful is that they are approximately accurate, and increasingly so over time (if in fits and sometimes with false starts).&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="putnam:mathematics:1979 vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many critics think the evidence of change in adoption of given theories, and varying degrees of empirical success over time, is hard evidence against the notion that scientific theories generally do refer in this way. Similarly, some theories once held to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; are now thought to be neither approximately true, nor even subsets of what is true. Larry Laudan, citing a number of changes in this vein, sniffs: “The realist’s claim that we should expect referring theories to be empirically successful is simply false.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:confutation"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the fact that science is an iterative and approximative process does not tell against the realism asserted. Any given theory may be substantially false. This does not mean all theories are &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; not to refer, only that realists must be critical, aware of the possibility of failure, and willing to hold their claims tentatively, especially at first. No scientist with a knowledge of the history of the discipline should think otherwise. Electrons might not exist; but at least for the present, there is good reason to treat them not only as useful but as real. The longer the predictions of the model are (not dis)confirmed by the evidence, the more reason scientists have for holding the conclusion confidently. Likewise, as other theories developed without direct reference provide further corroboration, it is increasingly rational to affirm a theory as true, as well as empirically useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, even if Laudan’s point is granted, it does not disprove realism. It simply proves naïve realism false—naïve, even. True: empirical success does not guarantee the truthlikeness of a theory, and vice versa. It does not follow that there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; correspondence between the two. Laudan insists that the truthlikeness of a given theory has zero bearing on its empirical fruitfulness, but it is at least possible that it is instead a contributory factor.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what about later theories which do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make special cases of the earlier theory? When Laudan, Kuhn, van Fraassen, and others examine e.g. the fluid and aether theories and compare them to the atomic theories now held by most physicists, they note that science has been empirically useful without being true in the past; the same may be true today. However, later views, currently held by realists to be accurate, can often explain the success of the earlier theory even without claiming it as a subset.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="putnam:three-kinds-of-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The atomic theory lets scientists explain the appearance of the aether. Newton’s mechanics can be applied to show why Ptolemy’s epicycles worked, even though they were false. The later theory not only has greater empirical success; its explanatory power also includes the now disconfirmed theory—whether as a special case or not. To be sure, the idea that all science proceeds linearly and that every theory is this kind of empirical superset of the former is incorrect.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still, the fact that later theories &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; can do so is further evidence that truthlikeness is a contributory factor in the success of scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="alternatives-to-realism" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Alternatives to Realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two broad categories of antirealism, rational and non-rational, both deny the rationality of believing science truly describes the world.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Larry Laudan’s instrumentalism, Bas C. van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, and J. P. Moreland’s eclectic approach are &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; antirealisms. They all affirm the rationality of the scientific enterprise and reject conceptual relativism.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Non-rational antirealisms such as a strong Kuhnian approach deny the rationality of science and affirm conceptual relativism. Each fails as a critique of or alternative to critical realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-larry-laudans-instrumentalism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;a. Larry Laudan’s Instrumentalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrumentalism takes the effectiveness of science as indicating only its effectiveness in delivering more reliable predictions.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Philosophers like Larry Laudan reject as both irrelevant and false the idea of “partial truth” or “verisimilitude” as incoherent: in a semantic model, statements are either true or false. This is partly fair: scientists claim their models have a semantic content corresponding approximately to the world. Yet the critique fails to account for the way scientists use the notion of “approximate-ness.” Models may be incomplete, yet yield correct results &lt;em&gt;when the approximation is appropriate&lt;/em&gt;. There are thus three important distinctions to be made. The first is between accuracy (how near the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; value a given experiment is) and precision (the repeatability of a measurement). An archer who consistently shoots four inches to the right of the bullseye is precise but not accurate; one who is always within two inches of the target but all around it is accurate, but not precise. The second is between accuracy and the philosophical binary of truth. A scientific model might in the strict sense be “false”—that is, even its predictions are not empirically &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, only &lt;em&gt;close to correct&lt;/em&gt;, while the model may be more accurate than any previous model. An arrow is either within the bullseye or not, but there is more to scoring an archery contest—and more to evaluating the accuracy of scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third distinction, and the most serious, is between models’ empirical content and their semantic content. A theory might be said to be “more true,” i.e. more &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;, than any predecessor, if it is more consistent with the empirical data or capable of explaining a broader set of such data. However, the semantic claim is more likely to be binary. Either there are electrons, or there are not. If not, there may be nothing very much like electrons at all. Even so, this distinction is less sharp than Laudan supposes. Increasing approximation of reality is possible. Models may have more or less fidelity. A perfectly round globe may strictly be a false representation of the earth, which is slightly squashed due to its spin; but it is nearer correct than a piece of paper or a donut. The earth is much more like a sphere than a plane or a toroid. If reality is more like the Standard Model of quantum mechanics’ description of electrons and quarks than it is like a pre-atomic view of reality, the Standard Model is a better approximation to reality than the pre-atomic view. Voiding the distinction between accuracy and binary truth is simply a category mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally Laudan shows how the scientific methodologies developed over the past several hundred years work, but not &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;—especially in cases quite different from his example of double-blind clinical studies.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In scenarios where technological control over the environment is at stake, science clearly has an edge on other methods (so his critique of relativism stands).&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It is less clear why drug trials should be amenable to this sort of testing if the human body and drug interactions are not &lt;em&gt;more like&lt;/em&gt; the scientific models than the non-scientific models. It was precisely the belief in the accuracy of such models which gave rise to the instrumentally effective methodology! One might posit, then, that &lt;em&gt;realism itself&lt;/em&gt; is instrumentally useful in the pursuit of these technological gains. The problem, of course, is that such an epistemic stance is difficult to maintain at best. It is one thing (and not a very controversial one) to say that the scientific method is instrumentally effective. It is another to say that belief in scientific realism is instrumentally effective and false, because no one can sustain a belief they think false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-bas-c.-van-fraassen-and-constructive-empiricism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;b. Bas C. van Fraassen and Constructive Empiricism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bas C. van Fraassen’s constructive empiricist model, science is (or at least should be) concerned solely with explaining the empirical data available to the human senses. Theories are useful but not true; they “do much besides answer the factual questions about regularities in the observable phenomena which, according to empiricism, are the scientist’s basic topic of concern.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three major problems confront van Fraassen’s view. One is van Fraassen’s prior commitment to materialist empiricism. He asserts, for example, that criteria such as mathematical elegance, simplicity, scope, completion, unification, and explanatory “provide reasons for using a theory… and &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; rationally guide our epistemic attitudes and decisions.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Why? Because he regards human observational powers as the sole grounds of knowledge. As such, he also rejects any critique of the limitations of “sense data” or problems with human perception as “armchair psychology” which can safely be ignored.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; point of interest, for van Fraassen, is explaining those regularities in observable phenomena. As Grover Maxwell comments, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely the main concerns of, say, a theoretical physicist involve such things as the actual properties and varieties of subatomic particles rather than mere predictions about where and how intense a certain spectral line will be.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even in conducting their ordinary research, theoretical physicists and chemists are concerned with things they think actually exist. However much van Fraassen thinks science &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; only concern itself with those regularities, realism seems basic to the scientific endeavor as actually practiced.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem for van Fraassen is closely related to the first: “empirical adequacy” is a necessary but insufficient condition for the acceptance of a scientific theory. Scientists do (and must) embrace those other conditions for accepting theories as true, and rightly so. Nothing about using those criteria to decide between theories is irrational in the least apart from van Fraassen’s prior commitment to empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, van Fraassen simply reasserts the distinction between observable and unobservable entities. He begins with the idea of in-principle unobservability, but on encountering Maxwell’s argument from technological improvements, he moves the goalposts. He has in mind, he says, the limitations of human beings “&lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; human beings;” technological aids actual or imaginable are irrelevant.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As shown above, though, the lack of any such clear distinction is the major problem for the antirealist interested in maintaining this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="c.-morelands-selective-antirealism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;c. Moreland’s Selective Antirealism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. P. Moreland suggests an alternative from within a Christian epistemology and ontology. He fully grants a generally realist epistemology and affirms a correspondence view of truth. However, he also approves a cautiously eclectic approach to &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; realism.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He offers two major criteria for adopting antirealist stances. The first is “in those cases where the phenomena described by that theory lie outside the appropriate domain of science, or the scientific aspect of some phenomenon is inappropriately taken to be the whole phenomenon itself.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example: scientific explanations of mind currently tend toward reductive physicalism. But if there are good reasons to suspect that the mind is not reducible to the brain (say: the whole history of dualist arguments), any scientific theory which purports to explain mind solely in terms of material function should be treated antirealistically—as instrumentally useful, but not &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. But a critically realist claim about physical-mental state correlation does not entail physicalism. Rather, the physicalist claim is not scientific but philosophical. This should certain chasten the materialists, but it is not proof against realism—not generally, and not even in the case of this specific theory. It is proof only against unwarranted extension from the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreland also argues that “an antirealist stances should be taken toward some scientific theory in those cases where a realist view conflicts with a rationally well-established conceptual problem for that theory but an antirealist view does not.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He suggests that the logically problematic claims of some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest a non-realist interpretation: “the indeterminacy in nature is due to the uncertainty of our knowledge of nature or our inability to measure nature and is not a feature of nature itself.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, if there are good philosophical reasons for rejecting infinite regress, one should be confident rejecting even an instrumentally-useful cosmological model of an infinite universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these latter examples, however, as well as in the further criteria he briefly mentions,&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreland lumps together two distinct phenomena under the same label of “anti-realism.” One is an in-principle denial that certain kinds of data are available to us; the other a denial that a &lt;em&gt;specific model&lt;/em&gt; comports with reality. One might think that all theories about electrons are permanently subject to antirealist critiques and that we can have no true knowledge of such allegedly unobservable entities. This is quite different from thinking that a given cosmological model is wrong. Both entail prior commitments, and the warrant in both cases arises outside science. They are nonetheless different kinds of claims: one about what is knowable, and one about what actually is. Even if Moreland’s criteria were granted, this is very different from van Fraassen’s empiricism or Laudan’s instrumentalism. Rejecting a given theory is quite different from rejecting the possibility of a theory being true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="d.-non-rational-antirealism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;d. Non-Rational Antirealism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest form of Thomas Kuhn’s description of scientific history emphasizes that the theories on either side of a scientific revolution are totally incommensurable, actually operating in “different worlds.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The shift away from Aristotelian is one where Galileo &lt;em&gt;saw differently&lt;/em&gt; than he had before.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kuhn’s protests that he understands the problem with the phrase notwithstanding, he regularly reverts to the idea that scientists before and after revolutions lived in different worlds.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This cannot be right: even if the theories are distinct in important ways, and even if are not totally commensurable, there are certainly data on which they can agree. Even if what the planets were seen &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; shifted between the Ptolemaic and the Keplerian eras, the basic observational data were agreeable to both, for example. Likewise, though mass has different semantic content in the Newtonian and Einsteinian conceptions, both agree on many of the empirical values—including problematic measurements which prompted to the transition between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken as a chastening of overconfident or naïve realism Kuhn’s historical critique is to be appreciated. His view of scientific revolutions leads him (or at least many of his readers) further, though—to conclude that observation is so theory-laden that, though the objective world is “out there” to describe, humans have no true access to it. The data itself is always subject to the flux of another revolution. Such a view, whatever its attractions, is first of all suspect simply on the reality that scientific approaches &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; accomplished goals (like predicting and controlling floods) which cut across scientific and non-scientific cultures.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Second, any such non-rational antirealism stands clearly opposed to the Biblical idea that truth is knowable and that both moral and empirical data may be true or not—that the final standard is not human knowledge but the God-created reality outside the human knower. Third, such a view is self-defeating, as it claims objective knowledge about scientific theories while purporting that no such objective knowledge is possible.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion-the-best-option" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Conclusion: The Best Option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific realism, then, is the best option. It has its limitations, and specific theories may well not be finally accurate descriptions of reality. Phlogiston, after all, is not real; it may turn out that quarks are not either. But neither radical skepticism nor even hard agnosticism are therefore warranted. Rather, a critical realism which acknowledges the limitations and possibility for inaccuracy in any given model is far more appropriate. This model best accounts for both science’s instrumental effectiveness as a standalone discipline and its applicability to other disciplines. It best makes sense of the philosophical issues around epistemology and ontology. It best explains how scientific theories advance over time, not necessarily linearly but such that later models to tend to be capable of treating earlier models either as special cases or as comprehensible misunderstandings. Not least, it best comports with the Biblical view of truth and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="part-ii-excursusrealism-and-creationism" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part II: Excursus—Realism and Creationism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antirealism holds an undeniable appeal to many young-earth creationists. If science is meaningful only in a pragmatic sense, then the creationist may happily accept the utility of science for technological innovation, while still rejecting scientific claims about the age of the earth and common descent of living organisms without any serious conflict. As Moreland comments, “After all, if one does not assume that evolutionary theory is approximately true or objectively rational, then why bother to argue against it or to integrate Christian theological claims about the history of life with evolutionary theory?”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The more traditional (and admittedly more straightforward) reading of the Genesis narrative may be maintained, and the propositions of secular science safely sidelined as merely useful models which say nothing about the actual world. More, the off-putting claim often associated with scientific realism, “that science or the scientific method represents the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; (or, more weakly, the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;) effective instrument for discovering truths about the world”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may be safely rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excursus aims to show that, whatever the appeals of an antirealist stance for young-earth creationism, such a view is deeply mistaken. First, as seen above in Part I, there are good reasons to embrace realism in general, and to reject the major alternatives on offer. Second, even if one embraces an eclectic stance, &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; J. P. Moreland, the relevant criteria do not apply to the creation-science debate specifically. Third, in order for the antirealist objection to prove useful in the creation-science debate, it must go far beyond those criteria anyway—it must treat nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; modern science antirealistically. It smuggles in a radical skepticism not especially congenial to Christian thought. It proves too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-argument-applied" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The Argument Applied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constructive empiricist program has severe problems for the Christian. As van Fraassen freely admits in the introduction to “The Scientific Image”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By empiricism I mean the philosophical position that experience is our source of information about the world, &lt;em&gt;and our only source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for a constructive empiricist view of science, then, is expressly the defense of empiricism. But empiricism as a worldview is antithetical to Christianity. Grover Maxwell searingly points out the underlying philosophical commitment: “the conviction that there are very few ontologically legitimate kinds of entities, perhaps only one.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Empiricism as an all-encompassing &lt;em&gt;gestalt&lt;/em&gt; must be distinguished from the employment of empirical methods within other paradigms, of course: the Christian believes that the God-given senses are broadly trustworthy as a means of acquiring knowledge. However, Christians do (and must) affirm that non-empirical sources of data provide real warrant for belief: particularly divine revelation. Constructive empiricism is plainly antithetical to Christian theism—and certainly no friend to a claim about the age of the earth driven entirely by special revelatory considerations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the two kinds of anti-realism regularly embraced by young-earth creationists are instrumentalism and J. P. Moreland’s eclectic antirealism. Instrumentalism is at least at first blush much more appealing an option for Christians than empiricism. It allows the believer to affirm that science produces enormously helpful insights for technological advancement and control of the world.&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Beyond the basic critiques of instrumentalism noted in Part I, however, there are further problems for the young-earth creationist considering instrumentalism as an “out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one might reject scientific approaches for measuring the age of fossils or the earth itself. Current isotope decay rates explain some observations, and are technologically applicable to e.g. managing nuclear reactors—but they are merely useful, not true. As such, they are certainly not applicable to the past. Therefore, any claims about their past behavior should thereby be ruled out of bounds. Granted that the past is strictly inaccessible to scientists, this should still give the young-earth antirealist some pause. Dating a manuscript or a particular piece of pottery is not terribly dissimilar to dating a fossil. Taking this stance equally rules out much of the archaeological support mustered for the antiquity of the Bible. For that matter, how can one know that paper did not transmute words in the past? Claiming that documents changed their meaning would seem patently silly, but there is no more and no less evidence for it than that isotope decay rates have changed. Historical investigation of any sort, but especially archaeology, depends on the accessibility of the past much as geology does. It is not at all clear that reasoning about the earth suddenly becomes out of bounds at some arbitrary point far enough back in the past, or that radiometric isotopes should be assumed to be reliable up to a given point but no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, while astronomy and geology seem at least partly to follows Laudan’s model of problem-solving—the practice of the disciplines results in more empirically-adequate explanations over time&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—his pragmatic approach asserts that science never approaches the truth whatsoever. Science solves empirical problems and helps humans accomplish certain technical tasks, but it reveals nothing of the world itself. Like van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, it is thus contrary to the biblical view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="morelands-criteria" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Moreland’s Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, many young-earth creationists such as Ken Ham take an explicitly realist stance toward science overall, arguing for something like the eclectic realism of J. P. Moreland, rather than a true instrumentalism or empiricism. This makes sense: it seems that one or more of J. P. Moreland’s criteria for eclectic antirealism might give warrant for taking an antirealist stance toward some of the relevant theories. However, even if Moreland is right that “We should not automatically assume that if science and theology conflict… the scientific theory should be read in realist terms and attacked accordingly,”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; there remain two major problems with applying Moreland’s criteria in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, even if Moreland’s criteria for skepticism are valid, they are not applicable to the majority of the data under consideration in creationist arguments about e.g. the age of the earth. His first criterion certainly does not apply: the investigation of questions like the age of the earth or the life-cycle of stars or even the relationship between various kinds of life on earth all seem to be well within the legitimate territory of scientific explanation. His second criterion, having “a rationally well-established conceptual problem for that theory [which] an antirealist view does not,”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seems more applicable. Surely a well-established history of young-earth exegesis counts as a “rationally well-established conceptual problem”? Indeed, this is the strongest argument in favor Moreland’s eclectic empiricism applied to the issue. But of course, interpretations of the early chapters of Genesis have varied widely throughout the history of the church. This suggests at the least that the problem is less well-established that its proponents might think or hope. Moreover, it is relatively straightforward to propose readings of the creation narratives which accord with both the rest of Scripture &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with science—far more straightforward than to propose entirely new, mutually compatible systems of physics, geology, biology, etc. The shoe seems to be on the other foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Moreland’s other suggested criteria?&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Most of the fields are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; especially young.&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Few of them (especially the cornerstone fields of astronomy, geology, and particle physics) have experienced a large proportion of theory replacement over refinement of existing theories. None of the fields are in a period of Kuhnian crisis. One stronger contender is that “non rational, sociological factors account for much of the theory’s acceptance by the scientific community.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This certainly looks to be the case in some ways, and it is fair to critique the scientific community on those terms. However, the same could equally be said of the young-earth creationist stance itself: it has at times been difficult even to get a job in conservative evangelical institutions while denying young-earth creationism.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, although the critique stands for some of the fields, it is certainly not applicable to all of them; there is no particular sociological pressure on findings about isotope decay rates relevant to the discussion, for example. Finally, one might claim of evolutionary biology that “the main virtue… is its empirical adequacy, and its more metaphysical, theoretical aspects can be understood as unnecessary, excess baggage”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—but again, the same can hardly be said of isotope decay or stellar life-cycle theories, neither of which has particularly strong metaphysical implications here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, related problem—conflating two distinct phenomena into a single label of “antirealism”—was noted above but warrants further discussion.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Again: one (strict instrumentalism or van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism) is an in-principle denial that certain kinds of data are available to us; the other a denial that a specific model is correct. So for example, one might think that all theories about electrons are permanently subject to antirealist critiques and that we can have no true knowledge of such allegedly unobservable entities; we can never know whether our theories about these things are in fact &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of whether this claim is correct, it is quite different from thinking that a given cosmological model is wrong, while another one is correct (and demonstrably so if certain key assumptions were to be revisited). Both of these entail prior philosophical commitments, and in both cases the warrant for critiquing the realist claim arises outside of science itself, e.g. from a commitment to empiricism, or from a specific reading of Scripture. But they are nonetheless different kinds of claims: one about what is knowable, and one about what actually is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can of course imagine an antirealist critique of the former sort being levied against some cosmological model or another, but this is not what young-earth creationists who adopt an antirealist stance toward cosmology (Moreland included) seem to be proposing. Moreover, precisely because these are different kinds of claims, the kinds of warrant for skepticism that are in play for scientific knowledge about electrons or quarks are quite different both in principle and practice from the relevant factors for cosmology, geology, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking an anti-realist stance toward these phenomena, then, requires a radical degree of skepticism—more radical than Moreland’s criteria warrant, and as it turns out with rather sharp consequences for other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="severe-and-undesirable-consequences" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Severe and Undesirable Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not sufficient to grant a certain suspicion about unobserved or indirectly observed phenomena.&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rather, the would-be &lt;em&gt;creationist&lt;/em&gt; antirealist must commit to rejecting the realist validity of some or all the claims of: nuclear physics, geology, and paleontology (with serious repercussions to archaeology); general relativity; evolutionary biology; and observational astronomy (with direct application to cosmology). The consequences are no less devastating for the Christian worldview than for the physicalist,&lt;a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; albeit for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the no-miracles argument applies not only to the question of realism in general but also to the age of the earth and universe specifically. It is profoundly unlikely that one could derive an empirically adequate scientific model of something like fundamental particles without any correspondence to reality. It is at least as unlikely that findings from a variety of unrelated fields should all agree, while also all being totally wrong. Though some young-earth creationists chalk up this outcome to conspiratorial forces in the sciences (so Henry Morris) or to the presuppositions held by non-Christian scientists (so many disciples of Van Til), the claim both strains credulity and also—more to the point—is simply inaccurate both historically and in the present. The history of scientific estimates of the age of the earth is particularly illuminating; committed Christian Lord Kelvin’s early and foundational work already pointed to an age in the millions of years at a minimum. Likewise, many working Christian scientists today find the evidence for the antiquity of the earth and the universe quite reasonable, and they would be neither member of a Morrisian conspiracy nor, as regenerate believers, subject to precisely the same Van Tillian noetic defects as their non-Christian colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent lines of evidence for the antiquity of the universe and the earth include: astronomical observation and theories of star formation; cosmological development models and the prediction and discovery of the Big Bang background radiation in line with those models; geological and paleontological observations and associated data from decay rates which derive from fundamental physics. Many of these lines of data arose independently but have since been found to confirm one another. For example, isotopic decay rates are both predicted by particle physics and well-verified, and provide an independent line of evidence for the age of the earth in line with the ways of estimating that age: from patterns of stratification, to tree ring samples, to similar measurements of the age of other objects in the solar system. Models built up from the plate-tectonic theory of geology corroborates paleontological evidence of geographic colocation of certain species in the past. Radiometric dating of the age of the earth also accords with analyses of the age of the universe based on current models of star life-cycles and the formation of heavy elements, which in turn accord with models of cosmological development. These astronomical observations and analyses depend on both general and special relativity as well. Moreover, the evidence for these individual claims appears quite defensible to many confessing evangelical Christians. That &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these independent lines of evidence, leaning on nearly every major area of physics, earth science, and biology should coincide at all—much less so neatly—while being entirely false is just the kind of miracle subject to the critique levied above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this kind of strong antirealism leads to a radical skepticism that seems very out of keeping with Scriptural teaching on the role of nature. Surely passages such as Psalm 19 and Romans 1 indicate clearly that the world has a kind of revelatory content, which points to the nature of the one who created it. But imagine the young-earth creationist adopts an antirealist stance toward astronomical observation as a way of rejecting the apparent age of the universe. This requires asserting all of the following: No star has gone supernova before the last 10,000 years, and thus the heavy elements were all created “in situ” and are not, as currently believed, the product of supernovae. Indeed, any kind of apparent stellar life-cycle is an illusion (or at least: has never actually been experienced by any star). The evidence of background radiation is merely coincidence, and is in fact unrelated to the apparent expansion of the universe indicated by the red-shift of stars further from the earth. The apparent expansion of the universe is just that: apparent only; it has only ever been fractionally different than it is. Whatever the apparent evidence, the light seen is not in fact from the stars apparently observed: given the apparent distance to most stars, and the best models of how stars work, many of the stars in the night sky would have ceased to be visible, whether by exploding into supernovae or by burning down to white dwarfs, long before they were actually created. In other words, there is literally nothing true revealed by observing the stars—not even the brute fact of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much the same could be said for the other sciences. The earth shows apparent geological history including incredible catastrophes—ice ages, impacts from meteors, and so on—which in point of fact &lt;em&gt;never happened&lt;/em&gt;. This is far more radical than instrumentalism, and stronger even than van Fraassen’s empiricism. It even goes beyond the kinds of claims advanced by the conceptual relativists. There is no possible evidence which could countervail against it. It is sheer fideism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antirealism, particularly of the instrumental or eclectic varieties, may seem appealing to Christians troubled by the claims advanced by modern science. Whether the concern is with a kind of materialist “scientism” which strongly asserts a monadic view of human consciousness, or the apparent contradictions between Scripture and claims about the age of the universe, treating science as useful but not necessarily &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; seems a helpful escape-hatch. However, adopting such a stance brings along so many other, and such severe, problems that whatever gains appears in this area seem not to be worth the cost—especially if there are other means of reconciling a realist view of science with Scripture’s teaching. Note that this does not mean that young-earth creationism is wrong. There may be other good reasons, including scientific reasons, to think that the earth is young.&lt;a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Programs of research oriented this direction may be fully realist while not affirming the veracity of any particular model. The distinction between principled antirealism and the rejection of a given theory is helpful and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at times maintain their views in the face of contrary evidence, or because of presuppositions they refuse to relinquish. But so may exegetes. If there is good reason to be a realist about science generally (and there is), and seemingly good evidence for the age of the earth (and there is), it behooves Christians at the least to hold their young-earth views tentatively. The strength of the claim that the earth is young, given all the evidence, warrants some humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuhn’s discussion of Galileo’s measurements vs. those conducted today is enlightening (see &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;, 50th Anniversary Edition (1962; repr., The University of Chicago Press, 2012).&lt;/span&gt; 119ff). Note, however, that though Galileo’s measurements are not reproducible today, reasons may readily be adduced for the measurements he took from within the context of later theories—the accuracy of the measuring apparatus available to him, for example. Kuhn’s objection is weaker than he thinks.&lt;a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific naturalism, as a worldview (not an instrumental technique applied in certain circumstances) is certainly question-begging. First, the claim that “the physical world is the only thing which exists” is fundamentally a philosophical and not a scientific claim. That is, if science is a broadly experimental approach to discovering truth about the physical world, it is incapable of determining whether a non-physical world exists, and it is not even asking—still less answering!—metaphysical questions about the nature of reality. The basic issues of epistemology, ontology, and ethics are themselves not subject to empirical analysis. Evidence from the natural world may certainly be useful and even helpful in considering these domains, but by definition cannot be finally determinative. For example: if the physical world is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the only thing which exists, what sort of purely physical test could demonstrate that? Likewise, if humans have cognitive access to spiritual realities, because they are dualist and not purely physical beings, they might have genuine non-physical experiential knowledge. No ontological, epistemological, or teleological claim is finally resolvable through merely physical testing; claims in such areas are finally philosophical and theological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the efficacy of science in the domain of explaining the physical world is in no sense evidence that it is a particularly effective way of describing &lt;em&gt;all things&lt;/em&gt;. This is akin to suggesting that because musical notation is particularly effective for representing notes to be played, it is the only form of notation required; all written words should immediately be discarded, as should all computer programs. That is, the utility of one form of description or program of study for a given domain does not make it immediately applicable to or indeed at all relevant for other domains. Even with the context of scientific efforts, this is obvious: different techniques are used in observational astronomy than in ecological analysis, and different methods of analysis in assessing the claims of theoretical physics than in analyzing data from a given paleontological dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most importantly for current debates, the efficacy of science in describing the physical world provides no evidence whatsoever that the physical world is the only thing which exists. To suggest otherwise is simply to commit a basic logical fallacy. This is obvious if the premises and conclusion are laid out explicitly: The argument might be laid out so: “(P1) Science describes the physical world effectively. (P2) Science does not and cannot describe the non-physical world. (C) Therefore, the physical world is the only thing which exists.” But the conclusion clearly does not follow from the premises, even inductively. The argument might be modified into an inductive form: “(P1) Science describes the physical world effectively. (P2) Science has provided increased effectiveness in describing an ever-wider variety of phenomena over time. (P3) In so doing, science has found physical explanations of phenomena which at one time seemed intractable to such explanations. (C1) Therefore, science will at some point in the future find physical explanations for all phenomena. (C2) Therefore, there are no non-physical phenomena.” Even so strengthened, there are two major problems with the argument. First, C1 is an incredibly strong claim, and the purported evidence toward it in this form’s P3 is itself disputed. Moreover, even if C1 were granted, it would offer some evidence for C2 but &lt;em&gt;would not prove it&lt;/em&gt;. There still might be reason to think that physical phenomena and their corresponding explanations were expressions of the will of a wise divine being, for example. Moreover, while claims for non-physical purposes for or fundamental explanations of physical mechanisms might then be on shakier ground in virtue of being apparently less simple, the physicalist would need to make a (philosophical) argument for the apparent scientific virtue of simplicity! There is no escape from claims which are themselves not even capable of being tested empirically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When two theories make contradictory claims, even were they to have empirically equivalent outcomes, the contradiction in their claims is not merely terminological or semantic. It is fairly easy to conceive of claims are &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; semantically different, but which have the same basic content: “That is a chair” and the Spanish equivalent “ésa es una silla” both have the same basic referents, and even intend broadly the same meaning. Their variance is terminological, by dint of being in two distinct languages. It is far more difficult to find two claims which are in opposition to each other, but their opposition is merely terminological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just the case in science. To make a claim, scientific or otherwise, is to assert something about the world as it actually is. Thus, “The sky is blue” and “The sky is green but appears to us as blue because all our eyes are defective in a way we cannot measure” would have the same base empirical content, but make very different claims about the nature of human sight and the sky. This particular claim is trivially testable in some other way; but different claims in fundamental physics—empirically equivalent string theories, for example—might not be trivially testable, or testable at all: they might be empirically equivalent in principle as well as in practice. But the trivial example serves to highlight the reality that empirical equivalence does not entail semantic equality. The blueness or greenness of the sky is not merely a matter of human descriptions of things. Rather, even though they are meaningful only because of their semantics, their semantics carry force that is not merely different ways of saying the same thing: that is one of the basic necessities for language to function. If different semantics did not actually entail different claims, communication would be impossible. Less pragmatically, if one affirms that the referents in question are in some sense “out there” and not merely the contents of human speech or human sense data—that is, if one embraces a correspondence theory of truth and a basically, albeit critically, realist view of human knowledge including scientific knowledge—then the notion that two claims are merely terminological variants even though their semantics stand in contrast is clearly false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take an example particularly appropriate to a science-and-religion course: it is quite conceivable that a disinterested god (quite different from the one we worship) and a pantheon of disinterested gods and a universe which came out purely by chance would all be empirically equivalent. Yet “there is one bored god out there” and “there is no god out there” and “there are many bored gods out there” are clearly and obviously not terminological variants of each other, even if there is no empirical way to tell them apart. A similar thing would hold of two string theories, one which postulated 12 and the other 28 hidden dimensions. Even if both yielded the same empirical predictions (which were verified) and were in-principle incapable of any further test, they would nonetheless be claims with semantic content about the nature of reality which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reducible merely to a terminological variant. The fact that the truth or falsity of a claim may not be knowable does not tell against its distinctive semantic content, only against its pragmatic utility. If one of the two string theories suggested above were true, it might not make any practical difference which one it was. After all, if the contents are permanently inaccessible to humans, and the theoretical consequences identical, then either may be used in the pursuit of other knowledge. However, by dint of the fact that they make distinct and countervailing claims to one another, at least one must be false. And truth is no small matter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension between realism, generality, and precision posited in biology is a function not of those constraints in general, but of the specific constraints on biology and other sciences dealing with what is often described as having “emergent” phenomena. The closer the science is to physical first principles, the less these terms stand in contrast. For example, in chemistry, a realist description of the chemicals in question is actually &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt; in dealing precisely with the terms in question. The behavior of the chemicals at large scales can be modeled more effectively precisely because the underlying principles are relatively well understood and the phenomenon describable not merely as a representative abstraction but in terms corresponding to what seem to be the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; characteristics of the system in view. The same is true of much of physics. For example, the idea of general relativity is (as its name suggests) extremely general, covering the behavior of all macroscopic systems at least; is sufficiently precise in its predictions to enable extraordinary feats of timekeeping and geolocation; and is understood by the majority of working physicists to be a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; and not merely a &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; description of how space-time behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises then: assuming the claim is correct for biology, why is this so? The answer seems to be that biological systems are not subject (at least so far as they are understood so far) to be capable of reduction to the same kinds of general theorems as the more purely physical sciences. Though biological is concerned of physical subjects, those subjects seem not to merely the expression of mechanistic phenomena (though of course this point is debated by some physicalist philosophers and scientists). Rather, their behavior emerges atop the underlying physical system, and then diverges in unpredictable ways from individual subject to individual subject. As a result, descriptions of the trends that occur in a given &lt;em&gt;population&lt;/em&gt; may be general, but do not do justice to the behavior of any one member of that population, and so are not &lt;em&gt;precise&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, ecologies are functions of &lt;em&gt;aggregate&lt;/em&gt; behavior, but that aggregation is something like the “average American family”: it is a description of no individual element within the system, but of the combined output of the whole system. Moreover, under even trivially different conditions (a lightning strike occurring in one place rather than another, for example, and changing the behavior of the animals in that area), the specific outcome of the system might have been meaningfully different—even if still able to be modeled under the same general descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, most effective general models of behavior in biological systems are neither realistic nor precise. Attempts to model the function of neurons are often precise, but intentionally non-realist and non-general, not least because in most organisms, neurons are non-generalizable: only the simplest creatures have non-differentiated neurons. But in each of these cases, these are functions of the kind of increasingly complex systems, which are not apparently describable purely in terms of their underlying components. The brain, for example, is composed not just of an extraordinarily large number of neurons, but of a great variety of kinds of neurons as well, and the neurons all have the same basic chemical makeup and the same basic genetic structure, but develop in different ways because of specific driving factors in their environment, signals from chemicals driven by other parts of the body, and so on. Any description of any part of this system will necessarily be subject to the constraints the biologist describes simply because there is no single underlying principle driving the system; rather, it is a complex system where each part informs the others. The same is true (and even more so) of systems made up of biological actors, such as communities and ecologies; it is unsurprisingly also a common feature of systems which include actors with agency (such as economics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle’s impetus theory provided an effective and predictively accurate (and indeed, &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt;) model of the behavior of objects in terrestrial contexts. Though it was later superseded by Newton’s model, which had no impetuses at all, Aristotle’s method was a perfectly defensible model because it accounted for the &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; phenomena well. The method worked because a number of constraints in the systems observed were not yet themselves understood. In a limited sense, Aristotle’s view could be construed as a &lt;em&gt;for-certain-conditions&lt;/em&gt; subset of Newton’s laws (though, strictly speaking, this is inaccurate). That is, in the conditions in which Aristotle made his observations, and failing to account for some of the phenomena for which Newton’s approach &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; account, the impetus model for motion was valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In systems where there is resistance—e.g., all terrestrial systems—objects do not remain in motion without some other object providing an impetus to them, and objects of different masses but the same basic size do not fall at the same rate. Newton’s revolution was not in denying this but in recognizing that the grounding assumptions were incorrect: terrestrial systems are a &lt;em&gt;subset&lt;/em&gt; of a broader possible systems. Because this is so, there exists a more general set of laws which govern the behavior of objects in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems. This in turn led to the recognition that Aristotle had made a false generalization from the observed (terrestrial) data: the idea that objects require impetuses to remain in motion was empirically sound, but incomplete. Thus, a feather and a similarly-weighted needle fall at different rates because their different densities and surface areas relative to their masses result in different degrees of resistance. A bowling ball eventually comes to rest because of the resistive forces it experiences due to friction. These are not the general case, but subsets of the broader laws Newton derived; but Aristotle’s formulation can readily be seen just as that subset, under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an unusual pattern in the history of science, and in fact is similarly applicable to Newton’s own system of mechanics, since superseded by both quantum mechanics and general relativity. As the constraints under which a given law operates become better-understood, it is sometimes possible (at least in the case of physical laws) to derive deeper generalizations about the systems in question, generalizations of which the currently-held set of laws are recognized to be a subset. Granted that at times, the new laws do not supersede but wholly replace the old model, and that both the Aristotle-Newton and Newton-Einstein/QM transitions contain some degree of this latter, it is still the case that newer theories ofttimes succeed because they demonstrate themselves capable of solving the same set of problems as the preceding theory, while also addressing many of the unresolved issues in it. So: Newton was able to derive more, and more accurate, predictions than was the Aristotelian model, and to provide more thorough explanations of the systems in question; and likewise Einstein than Newton. In both cases, however, the original model had the utility it did (and the empirical success it did) precisely because it was in some way a &lt;em&gt;for-certain-conditions&lt;/em&gt; subset of the more general theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rather more interesting contrast, then, is between theories where the earlier theory is not even construable as a for-certain-conditions subset of the later, as in the phlogiston theory of combustion, since replaced by an oxidizing view. The idea had substantial explanatory power and harmonized quite well with the data, but was ultimately overthrown by the alternative (and now current, albeit revised) view of oxidation. Such cases, unlike the Aristotelian-Newtonian or Newtonian-Einsteinian/quantum mechanical transitions, are much harder to reconcile with a progressive view of the development of scientific theory, or with realist accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to mistake &lt;em&gt;exactness&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;explanatory power&lt;/em&gt; in the realm of explanation. Thus, it might be tempting to suppose that precise and consistent statistical regularities have greater explanatory power than inexact laws which have an attendant set of constraints and conditions specifying when and how they apply. However, the inverse is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical regularity has &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; explanatory power. It has enormous utility, in that it allows effective prediction. However, it provides no insight into the reason why the regularity is captures occurs. Explanation is at core a matter of determining the reasons why something occurs, not simply observing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; it occurs. If on every first, second, and third Tuesday of the month for three hours early in the afternoon small black marks are rendered onto a mostly white LED display, and the range of marks is tightly bounded, and the marks are known to form meaningful words and sentences and even stories, and there can therefore be strong statistical confidence that &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday the same pattern will occur again, this does nothing to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; the marks. What suffices as an explanation is a person using a typewriter to compose the draft of a novel on those Tuesdays when she has a babysitter for her children. This is certainly not even a &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt; law, and yet it has substantially greater explanatory power than does the statistical observation, regardless of the degree of statistical precision available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, even inexact laws subject to restrictions and limitations are capable of offering meaningful explanations, because they can offer insight into the causal mechanisms which drive the processes. Though such statements of causality are inherently circumscribed to a certain degree—the &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt; clauses are necessary—they retain the explanatory power that inheres in causal reasoning. It is both legitimate and explanatory to reason that “all other things being equal, Superman will win in a fistfight with Batman because he has superhuman strength and is functionally invincible to human weaponry.” Granted that all other things may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be equal (as in the famous 1980s story from which recent cinema drew more or less inspiration) and that Batman may, if he has access to Kryptonite, bring about a different outcome, in no way diminishes the explanatory power of the original statement. In fact, it may strengthen it by suggesting what kinds of things must be equal for the statement to hold, and suggesting other kinds of causal factors in the system. Since the system that is the universe—even Batman and Superman’s universe—is very large, it is unsurprising that causal relations can only be described with these kinds of constraints. After all, only God could know the total set of forces acting on a system and therefore could deliver a non-&lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt; statement of causal factors exhaustively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that statistical regularity is useless for explanation. In fact, it is a powerful tool for reasoning about the state of the world as part of deriving &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt;-constrained causal statements. To derive such causal statements, one must (usually) first derive sufficient data on which to base an analysis at all. Thus, knowing that Superman has been completely invulnerable to all human weapons of whatever magnitude in the past, and that Batman is an ordinary human, is important in being able to state that Superman will win in an ordinary fistfight between the two. The statistical data drives an inference to the best &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; that he is in fact invulnerable to ordinary human weapons (an explanation which we as outside readers know in fact to be true), and grounds the “all other things being equal” statement. If other factors are introduced, so that other things are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal, the inference from that statistical data set will still hold; but now other causal elements are in play and new statistical data would need to be gathered, for the sake of further reasoning &lt;em&gt;to explanation&lt;/em&gt;. The two go hand in hand, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural sciences all claim to use the same basic model of knowledge, and claim to aim for the same kind of explanatory power: the &lt;em&gt;law&lt;/em&gt;. However, clearly the kinds of laws which have such force in chemistry and especially physics are at least much less common in the other sciences; they may be entirely absent. Biology serves as a prime example of an unquestionably “hard” science in which laws are much harder to come by. Whereas physics includes both descriptive laws (&lt;em&gt;PV = nRT&lt;/em&gt;) and explanatory laws (general relativity), biology seems entirely limited to the former. That is, there are e.g. laws describing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; populations behave in an ecosystem, but there are no systematizing principles which are thought to offer the same degree of broad explanatory and predictive power as, say, the Standard Model of quantum mechanics. The closest example is a broadly Darwinian model of evolution, but even leaving aside questions about the accuracy of the model, it differs substantially from physical or chemical laws. It offers far less in the way of precise predictions, for one. For another, althought it serves as an explanation, the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of explanation it offers is distinct in that it does not seem to have the kind of (nomic) necessity possessed by physical laws: even if Darwinian evolution is the means by which life arose on the planet, it by no means requires that life arose &lt;em&gt;as it did&lt;/em&gt;; Certainly it is possible that life could have taken other forms even under the same selective pressures, given some other mutation—or have failed to succeed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological systems (and yet-higher-level systems like ecologists or economies) demonstrate phenomena that &lt;em&gt;supervene&lt;/em&gt; on the underlying physical realities. Unlike physics or chemistry, these phenomena seem, perhaps permanently, resistant to reductive and unifying explanations. This is precisely because of their lack of nomic or causal necessity: counterfactuals are easy to imagine in biology; much less economics. In the most abstract sciences—behavioral psychology, sociology, and economics, for example–it seems that human agency plays a major part in the actual outcomes in the world. Physicalist/materialist claims notwithstanding, it seems quite unlikely that such agency can be reduced to the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of chemical and electrical activity in the brain.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even at the level of microbes, however, the so-called “emergent behavior” of biological systems is not reducible to mere physical &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; as is the case in physics and chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, counterfactuals play one significant part in this: biological systems could be other than what they are. But another significant factor is the purposive nature of organisms. Even the simplest living things&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a teleological bent. Even if they were not designed, they themselves carry out certain patterns of &lt;em&gt;directed&lt;/em&gt; behavior. They take in energy (eat). They reproduce. Even if this behavior is entirely deterministic, arising purely from the physical states of the organism, it remains irreducible to principles with broad explanatory force. “All living things consume from their environment for energy” is not an explanation; it is a description. &amp;quot;Objects’ motion as described by ‘gravity’ derives from the curvature of space-time’ is an explanation and not merely a description. Biological systems, still less conglomeration of such systems (especially those with minds!) both exist and behave in trivially counterfactuals ways, and therefore not only do not but probably &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; have the kind of nomic necessity present in non-emergent systems. If such a system does exist, it must consist of properties well outside our current sphere of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the physical state of the brain is closely related to and indeed affects mental state is unsurprising; that they would be the sole cause of mental states (and that there is no influence running the other direction) is a much stronger, and much less well-justified claim.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many differences do not admit of clear or hard distinctions. The difference between science and pseudo-science is just such a difference. There is a clear and intuitively obvious difference between astronomy and astrology, between medical research and homeopathic remedies, between chemistry and alchemy. This is so even though it is difficult (if not impossible) to specify exactly what set of criteria are both necessary and sufficient to constitute one thing as a pseudo-science and another as actual science. This is not a difficulty specific to this differentiation; few categories are truly binary. Instead, humans normally and rationally distinguish between kinds of things on the basis of sets of criteria. So, as the well-known example from discussions of realism and anti-realism makes clear: humans can tell a bald man from a man with a full-head of hair, even though there is no single point at which one stops being hirsute and starts being bald. Likewise, we can recognize a sunny day from a cloudy day, even though there is a spectrum ranging from &lt;em&gt;not a cloud in the sky&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;clouds so thick and dark it seems like twilight at midday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of science and pseudo-science, there are a broad set of criteria which form a sort of diagnostic battery. Different (though overlapping) sets of tests are applicable in different fields. There is one set of discriminants between astronomy and astrology. There is another set between chemistry and alchemy, and another between pharmaceutical research and homeopathy. All share commonalities, but are not identical. For example, astronomy and astrology both rely on observation of the same celestial phenomena; pharmaceutical research and homeopathy both aim to treat physical ills by way of some external treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the astronomy/astrology divide, the major distinction is &lt;em&gt;applicability&lt;/em&gt;. Astronomy applies the observed data to understanding the subject under observation: stars, galaxies, and so on. Astrology applies the observed data to &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; subjects (namely human lives). The applicability of observations about stars to analysis of stars is straightforward and obvious. The applicability of those observations to predicting human affairs involves a substantial leap from the observation to a non-(physically-)associated subject. The latter is not logically inconceivable: even in a purely physical system of causation, it is possible that the stars’ positions were designed by some creative force to provide just such indicators. However, the claim advanced is much stronger relative to the relationship between the data and the purported effect; the applicability much less obvious; and (last but not least) the claim as usually advanced is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; physical but mystical. Again: this does not in and of itself mean astrology is not &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. It does mean that it advances claims that are both outside the means by which science is conducted (which, when prediction is involved, usually involve some degree of falsifiability), and also outside the normal &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; of observations within science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical research and homeopathy distinction shares some but not all of these difference-markers. There is certainly an element of repeatability and falsifiability in play, for one. (How effective this actually is, given recent studies in repeatability in pharmaceutical work especially but the sciences in general, is an important related question, but not ultimately final.) However, they do not share the applicability issue in the astronomy/astrology divide. The subject—sick humans—is the same. So is the treatment pattern. Nor is there generally an appeal to non-physical realities. The distinction here seems to be &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one of methodology and empiricism. The differences between chemistry and alchemy are of a similar nature. But other science/pseudo-science distinctions will look different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, then, is not that it is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to distinguish between science and pseudo-science, but that there are a broad set of criteria involved in making those distinctions, and the criteria are overlapping but not identical in different fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible point of difference between philosophy and science is the way they proceed toward answering questions and understanding the world. For example, “Corpuscularianism was mere philosophy. Atomism is science,” suggests an important difference: between reasoning from first principles and reasoning from observed phenomena in the world. The idea is that the corpuscularian idea derived not from observations about the world external to the thinker, but from abstract reasoning about the world—that is, not from &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; but from &lt;em&gt;first principles&lt;/em&gt;. This distinction, while initially appealing, has several problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it simply does not square with the actual history of science. A number of significant advances have come from reasoning about the world. Einstein’s analyses, across all fields (including some related to atomistic views of the world) were famously the product of initial thought experiments &lt;em&gt;followed&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;preceded&lt;/em&gt; by mathematical derivation and finally observational data. To be sure, there are many times when scientific understandings change because of data. But this is not the only way scientific interpretations shift. Rather, changes in epistemology, metaphysics, and other prior commitments may lead to substantial reinterpretations of the same data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those reevaluations may themselves produce further scientific work. One thinks of the way quantum mechanics developed over the twentieth century—including the substantial resistance to it from those enamored of more classical and determinist models, Einstein among them; and the multiple interpretive schemes for dealing philosophically with the implications of quantum mechanics’ findings. These are themselves conditioned by the evidence—but do &lt;em&gt;and must&lt;/em&gt; supersede it in explanatory power and scope. The various interpretations of quantum mechanics are interpretations not only of the data but the world in which the data lives. A radical indeterminism view, an observer-affected data view, a hidden variable view, and so on all offer up points of view which inform the work done by the scientists themselves in an inherent feedback loop. Philosophy and science are not the same, but they are inextricable from each other; one’s prior commitments inevitably shape the answers one will find to some degree or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this view fails to deal with the way that those philosophical commitments drove scientific exploration. The belief in a corpuscularian was part and parcel of the discovery of atomism. That there were philosophical reasons for accepting the view prior to observational evidence for it actually serves to reinforce rather than undercut the view. Indeed, the phrasing of the proposition itself is suspect. “Mere” philosophizing, as noted above, necessarily underlies all scientific research programs. At the most basic level: a commitment to the existence of an external world to be interacted with and discovered, the reliability of experience as a kind of evidence, and the generalizability of data via induction and inference to the best explanation are all necessary for the practice of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if one entirely rejected in an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; sense that it was possible to discover anything not directly observable (say, because one rejected any sort of corpuscularianism, or because one was a strict anti-realist, or for any number of other reasons), one would simply not look for evidence in that direction. Whatever experiments revealed, an individual with those commitments would not go looking for atoms or evidence of them. The evidence might, over time, suggest a revision of the worldview, and this sort of empirical refutation of the paradigm is of course the point of the proposition. Unfortunately for the proposition, this is not a distinction between philosophy and science, but between unrelenting dogmatism and critical realism. Science may be deeply dogmatic, and philosophy may readily revise its conclusions in the face of new evidence. Such evidence may differ in kind: it might be a a logical proof rather than physical data, as Gödel’s incompleteness theorem forced a revision in logical positivism. It does not, however, lead to an in-principle difference in method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id="god-is-with-us" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;God Is With Us&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading a long article on President Obama’s foreign policy, and something caught my attention as I was reading through the article. There’s a great scene where they’re sitting on a plane in another country, and people are waiting for the President to get off the plane, and the reporter tries to prod him that it might be time to leave, and the President just keeps talking. And what struck me was that &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt;, where he could prod the President that &lt;em&gt;maybe it’s time to leave.&lt;/em&gt; You don’t get that kind of relationship by standing up in the middle of a White House press conference and demanding up-close and personal access. You get it because the President initiates it and invites you to have it with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a fairly obvious analogy to our friendship with God here, and you may well have heard it before. But it rings true. And more than true, in this case: it’s as if the President came and said, “Hey, I’m going to make you a room in the White House. But in the meantime, I’m going to come live with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; and share everything I have with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read through the passage, look for two things, our two themes for this evening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We love and obey God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God dwells with us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: &lt;em&gt;we love and obey God&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God dwells with us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="body" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read with me, starting in verse 15, and on down through verse 31:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.&amp;quot; Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” Jesus answered him, &amp;quot;If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;section id="i.-we-love-and-obey-god" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I. We love and obey God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this passage, we see those two themes: we love and obey God, and he dwells with us. And they always seem to come in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at verse 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or verse 21:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by the Father…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or verse 23:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the same token:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our obedience doesn’t &lt;em&gt;bring about&lt;/em&gt; the Spirit filling us. Our obedience isn’t why God dwells with us. In fact, it’s Jesus’ obedience to the Father, going to die at the hands of the ruler of this world, down there in verse 30, and his resurrection, which we see in verses 18–20, which make fellowship with God possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clearly, our obedience matters. It’s constantly tied to God’s dwelling with us in this passage. Jesus opens with it because he was talking with people who &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; love him. This is &lt;em&gt;comfort&lt;/em&gt; in the midst of what is about to be a very difficult trial. When they might feel left alone like orphans, and needed to known they were his, and he would come back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why obedience? Because it is a sign of love. We see that at the end of the passage, in Jesus’ love for the Father and his obedience flowing out of that. And we can see it in our own lives, too. If my daughters are dishonoring their mom by disobeying her, there is something wrong with their love for her. Sometimes when we are talking to or disciplining our three-year-old, we tell her, “Hey, your loves have gotten out of order.” She is loving good things, but in the wrong proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we all do that. When we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; obey God, when we don’t keep his commandments, it is precisely because we our loves are disordered or mis-ordered. We love things in the wrong way, or we have love them with the wrong priority. Above all, we love other things more than our Father. Not like Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it look like when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; love God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one, &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; his words. You can’t keep them if you don’t know them!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Bible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about what Jesus said with friends and family, just as part of the ordinary course of your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorize Scripture, so it’s there in your mind as you go through life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice daily obedience to his words—not just the flashy, exciting kind, but the ordinary ways we seek holiness.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be kind to your neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love your in-laws well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell others the good news of all that Jesus has done and will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help your kids with their homework even when you’d rather be reading, and don’t be grumpy at them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal with your children graciously, kindly, and patiently, even when disciplining them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give generously to support the church and missions work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give generously to those who are in need, period—to whomever asks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgive others when they do you wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell others of this great hope and joy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live in community with other believers: be open to correction, and to encouragement—and give the same!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repent of your sins, both privately and publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve where there are needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn the other cheek and bless those who curse you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your work whole-heartedly, for the sake of the God who dwells in you, and not for man!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest and truthful in your financial and professional dealings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, that’s not a list of ways to get into God’s good graces. It’s a list of ways we respond because we are are already in God’s good graces. Those are things we do because we are confident we are loved. We show him our love by our joyful obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in truth, we find that hard. We need help, dealing our disordered and our mis-ordered loves. We forget that we are loved. We forget that we’re not alone, orphans in a cold world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ii.-god-dwells-with-us" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II. God Dwells With Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re not. God dwells with us. That’s the hope, and the help, that we need. God dwells with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at that question there in the middle: Judas (not Iscariot) asks, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” That’s a good question. And what Jesus does here is take his first answer, and carry it even further out of the realm of what Judas understood then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus opens this passage, having just told them how he is going to go away to the Father and prepare a place for them, and he says, “I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper” (another advocate, or a friend-in-court, someone to carry you through the trial) “to be with you forever.” The disciples were where, I think, any of us would be in their shoes. &lt;em&gt;Jesus says he’s ‘going to his Father’? What does that mean? Are we going to be alone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I traveled for work, and I ended up being gone for about a week and a half. I have two little girls, and one of them was about nineteen months old then, and she was a &lt;em&gt;wreck&lt;/em&gt; after that. For weeks, every time I went &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; the door—if I so much as went to take out the trash, she would &lt;em&gt;lose&lt;/em&gt; it. She didn’t understand where I had gone, or why, or when I was going to come back. And she loves me. She didn’t want me to leave again. She wanted me to be with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the disciples were. It makes sense. That’s why Jesus told them, “I’m not going to leave you as orphans. I will come to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Jesus explains &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he will come to them: “I will ask, and the Father will send you a Helper, and he will be with you. The world won’t see me, but I will show myself to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,” you can see where Judas’ confusion comes from. Jesus’ answer, and really this whole passage, points us to &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t fully capture all this passage says. I have wrestled with it for &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt;, and there is just so much here. I can’t capture it. Look at verse 23: “If anyone loves me,” Jesus says, “he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t give you a summary, but maybe a window, looking at an ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God dwells with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God… dwells… with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said “a window on an &lt;em&gt;ocean&lt;/em&gt;” because the depths here… More than an ocean, there is a &lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt; of depth here. There are depths here which we will never finish plumbing. We could, for eternity, dive deeper, and deeper into that reality. We &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; for eternity dive deeper. But we will never exhaust its depths. We will never say, “Oh: that’s how deep the love of God goes; that’s where it stops.” And this mystery? There is more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God dwells with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a believer, if you love God and keep his commands, this ocean is yours. And friend, listen: if you’re hearing this word and you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; yet love God—you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; keeping Jesus’ words—&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what is freely offered to you: in Jesus’ first dwelling with us in the Incarnation; in his life, obeying the Fathers’ plan all the way through to his death on our behalf; in his resurrection; in his asking the Father to send the Spirit—salvation offered freely to you. The God who has always been, the God who exists in eternal love in the Trinity, wants to dwell with you. So turn from your rebellion against God, and love God—and know that you are loved by him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He promised them they would see him again (in verses 19–20), a pointer to the resurrection. But more than that, we see in his promise of peace, and even in his telling them ahead of time that he was leaving, preparation for the time when he would have ascended. Like now. We don’t see Jesus with these eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still need to know we’re not orphans. We still need peace, and not like the world gives it. We need God to be with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine there were a way I could tell my little girls, “I’m going away to do some work for you, but even while I’m gone, I will come to you.” Isn’t that what Jesus does here? “I’m going to my Father to prepare a place for you” but now, to your distress about that: “the Father and I will come to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? “I will ask the Father,” Jesus says in verse 16, “and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, the spirit of Truth… he dwells with you, and will be in you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit of the living God: his breath; our helper, our advocate and friend-in-court; our teacher, who will remind us of everything Jesus said to us, who inspired these Scriptures and now applies them to us; the peace that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Jesus didn’t go away and leave them orphans. He didn’t leave &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God dwells with us, because his Spirit is with us and in us. And just as the Father and the Son are one (as we see both earlier in this chapter, and again here in verses 20 and 24) the Spirit is one with the Father and the Son. They act together, but it’s more than that. The way Jesus talks in this passage: “We will come to him, and make our home with him”; or the way Paul talks in Ephesians: “You are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit”. Where the Spirit is, the Father and the Son are, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the Father does as the Son asks, and sends us the Spirit to dwell with us, he is giving us &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt;. We have access in one Spirit to the Father. When someday we are glorified, and heaven has come down to earth, and the dwelling place of God is physically with man, when we can see the risen Lord with our own eyes—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit will still dwell with us. He is with us &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;. He is our union with God. Jesus is in the Father, and we are in him, and he is in us—through the &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We somehow—again, depths beyond us—we participate, through the Spirit, in the life of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He, mystery of mysteries, he wants to dwell with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusionexhortation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion/Exhortation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we close tonight, three things to take away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflect.&lt;/strong&gt; John wants us to reflect on this mystery: God has made us his &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;. God dwells with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obey.&lt;/strong&gt; If we love him, we’re going to obey Jesus’ words. So remember that as we go out from here. Keep his word—not to persuade God to love you, but because he &lt;em&gt;already does&lt;/em&gt; love you, because he &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; dwells with you, because you and I together are &lt;em&gt;his temple&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;his tabernacle&lt;/em&gt;. So keep his word. Demonstrate (like you would to a friend or a child or a spouse, but so much more) that you &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace.&lt;/strong&gt; As we go out from here, we might think to say, “God be with you!” But perhaps better, in light of this passage, to say, “God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; with you. Go in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahner’s Rule famously states that “the ‘economic’ Trinity is the ‘immanent’ Trinity, and the ‘immanent’ Trinity is the ‘economic’ Trinity.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The dictum has been much debated and stands as a major point of consideration—not to say contention!—in modern Trinitarian doctrinal discussion. This paper will establish that Rahner’s rule, rightly understood and articulated,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is correct and essential for the Christian faith, and leads inexorably to the conclusion that the names “Father,” “Son,” and “Spirit” are titles of God in being, and not only in activity. The triune &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; of God are the result of his triune &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;; therefore, God’s work in salvation history is truly self-revelatory. Thus, Christians may claim to have right and proper, though not exhaustive, knowledge of the divine nature through his mighty works in history. The one true, Triune God has acted in history as the Father of Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Logos, and the Spirit of the Father and the Son—and in this he has not presented a charade, but the Godhead as it truly is. Thus, Christians are right to understand God as being &lt;em&gt;in essence and being&lt;/em&gt;, and not merely in &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;—that is, &lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;—Father, Son, and Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definition of the terms may be helpful: the “economic” Trinity is the Trinity at work in history (and especially salvation history). The “immanent Trinity” is God present to himself (&lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;); it might well be termed the “ontological” Trinity or “eternal” Trinity.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, Rahner’s claim entails at least 3 sub-claims: God is Trinity in being; God’s Triune nature is revealed &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; through (salvation) history; and God’s Triune nature is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; revealed through salvation history.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Responses to Rahner’s dictum since its 1970 publication in &lt;em&gt;The Trinity&lt;/em&gt; have taken it in one of two major directions: “radicalizing” and “restricting.” Authors following the radicalizing course reduce the immanent Trinity to the economic trinity. As a consequence, they often tie human knowledge of (and sometimes the actual being of) God to his development along with the cosmos, or to human experience of God in the Incarnation specifically. In constrast, the “restricting” interpreters affirm Rahner’s rule but note its limits. In particular, they tend to emphasize that the being of the Trinity is independent of salvation history, though rightly revealed in it.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="sanders"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This paper takes the later stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="scriptural-basis" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scriptural Basis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several passages in the New Testament emphasize most clearly the integral (and not merely functional) unity and relationship of the Father and the Son, and likewise the essential relationship of Spirit to Father and Son. In each case, the claim’s truth depends on the eternal relations between the persons being precisely those revealed in salvation history.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his prologue, John is at pains to demonstrate that the Logos eternally dwells as Logos and as God—and &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;. In 1:14, John emphasizes that the glory of the Incarnate Word is as (that it: it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;) the glory of the only Son from the Father. He follows this with the assertion that “the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known” (verse 18). In John 10:15, Jesus himself proclaims that he knows the Father and the Father knows him; in 10:30 he declares, “I and the Father are one.” The consistent claim of John’s gospel, then, is: Jesus, the Incarnate Logos, knew and revealed the Father as his Son. For the claim to be coherent or true, two things must hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Jesus’ knowledge of God as his Father could not merely be a statement of the state of affairs between them during the Incarnation. If that were the case, the knowledge he claims would be knowledge not of the Father as he is, but only of the human experience of God as wholly other, transcendent, unreachable—not, that is, of God as immanent. It would not be the knowledge of God as he is within his own triune self. Second, and consequentially, the revelation Jesus offered his disciples of God would likewise be not of God as he is in himself, but only the human experience of God. If God is not Father to the Son and Son to the Father &lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;, but only in acts in history, then the revelation of God as the “Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Eph. 1:3, Col. 1:3). Moreover, the apostles claimed Jesus to be “the image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15) in whom “all the fallness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:19); the “radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature” (Heb. 1:3). Again, if Jesus’ acts in history can be separated from his &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, these claims become meaningless. Jesus’ Sonship and his making a way to the Father are central to the apostolic preaching. If Sonship and Fatherhood are not part of God’s nature, Jesus could neither have imaged God nor carried the exact imprint of his nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Jesus’ promise to ask the Father to give the Spirit (14:16–17), which finds its fulfillment after the ascension of the Son, highlights the eternal relation between the persons. Whether during or after (or indeed before) the Incarnation, the Son speaks to the Father &lt;em&gt;as Father&lt;/em&gt;, and the Father sends the Spirit &lt;em&gt;as his Spirit&lt;/em&gt; at the Son’s request &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, in John 14:15–29, Jesus explains that the coming of the Spirit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the coming of the Son. To have the Spirit of truth is to have the Son who is in the Father, in oneself. The Father and the Son come to a believer when the Spirit comes to her (14:20). The Son comes to the one whom the Spirit indwells (14:21, 28). The Spirit proceeds from the Father and bears witness about the Son who sent him (15:26). But as with the persons of the Son and the Father, this identity cannot be if the persons are not merely acting in this way, but rather eternally subsist, eternally are &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; the Father of the Son and Son of the Father and Spirit of the Father and the Son. How could the Spirit bear witness truly to the Son, or rightly be said to be sent by the Father, if the Son and Father are not actually Son and Father, but only act as such in the history of salvation? In that case, the Spirit might be sent in salvation history, but would not bear witness to the Son as he is &lt;em&gt;in himself&lt;/em&gt;. The revelation would be of something less than God—not at all what Jesus promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, it is clear: Scripture claims that the actions of the Triune God in history reveal him as he is. The Son truly reveals the Father. The Father truly sends the Spirit through the Son. The Spirit truly glorifies the Father and the Son. These are so because the Spirit, Son, and Father act in accordance with their eternal, immanent relations. The efficacy of God’s reconciling, saving work—the Son drawing people into his own communion with the Father through the indwelling Spirit—depends on the economy of salvation being the outworking of God’s own nature. Their relations within the Godhead which precede, ground, and perfectly inform their actions. Thus, Rahner’s rule might helpfully be elaborated and rephrased: the economic Trinity (rightly and truly, but inexhaustively) reveals the immanent Trinity, because the economic trinity derives wholly from the being of the immanent Trinity. Being drives action, and action (partially, but truly) reveals being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="rahner-evaluated" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rahner Evaluated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Rahner’s Rule is strictly correct, his own elaboration of these ideas has its limits: not least in its tendency, as he developed it, toward modalism.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, Letham observes that Rahner’s discussion of persons as “distinct manners of subsisting” leaves little room for &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; between the subsisters.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, the solution is not to abandon Rahner’s dictum, but to press on it more firmly, more clearly, and more Scripturally. After all, the Scriptures bear witness to the triune God’s actions precisely as their interacting not merely as “subsistences” but as persons-who-love. The Son does the Father’s will and shows the Father truly, and they send to their people the Spirit who communicates everything of the Father and the Son. As Torrance comments:&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when we approach God as Father through the Son, our knowledge of the Father in the Son is grounded in the very being of God and is determined by what he essentially is in his own nature… in Jesus Christ we are really enabled to know God in accordance with his own nature as Father and Son…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case if the economic Trinity and the immanent Trinity are truly distinct. The Incarnation reveals God as he is in himself &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the God’s works flow from his being and essence, in the relations Father, Son, and Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Letham is right that Rahner partially neglects the immanent Trinity and limits himself to the human experience of the economic Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, Rahner regularly falls prey to a trap Athanasius avoids: seeing the Father, especially in the Old Testament, primarily as &lt;em&gt;unoriginate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Worse, he derives the person of the Father from the knowledge of the Father.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He fails to apply the second half of his dictum. If the first half emphasizes that the Trinity’s actions reveal the divine being, the second half emphasizes that those actions flow out of the divine being. The acts of the Godhead in history reveal to God’s nature because they are not merely human experiences, but the God’s self-revelation of his own being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahner largely has the right of this elsewhere. He notes that when Jesus considers himself as Son, he considers not only his human but also his divine relation to the Father as that of a Son.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The incarnate Son reveals both the Father truly, and also that the Incarnate Logos is Son and not Father.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The same must be said of the human relationship to God through the Spirit.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Spirit who communicates the love and grace and forgiveness the Father has effected by the work of the Incarnate Son is God. He communicates God as he is, as the &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of the Father’s self-revelation in the Son.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Spirit is the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of the Son; he is the true presence of both; he shares their mutual love and joy, and communicates both to believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Frame objects to another misstep Rahner’s rule might prompt: “There is a difference between what God is necessarily and what he freely chooses to do in his plan for creation.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No necessity demanded creation, salvation, or indeed any of God’s acts in history.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham torrance barth:I.2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They are &lt;em&gt;gifts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:IV.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They are acts in which the Trinity is evidenced, and therefore are truly revelatory; but this is because God faithfully acts in accord with his own nature.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham barth:II.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, the realities of the Trinity “either are in God himself… or they exist only in us… as effects of the divine creative activity. But then… there occurs no self-communication, God himself is not there, he is only represented by the creature…”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; God is not obliged to act in a particular way in salvation history, but his actions truly reflect his being. It is because “God is, ‘before’ creation took place, already a being-in-relation”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="gunton"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that he is free of necessity in creation or salvation. The Trinity does not need anything, for Father, Son, and Spirit are eternally in relation to one another. God does not need to create, to redeem, even to reveal himself; “God’s self-unveiling remains an act of sovereign divine freedom”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:I.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—but creation, redemption, and revelation are still acts of self-unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if Rahner’s rule is pressed to the point where God’s triunity is restricted to (or by) his acts in history, it is wrong, for precisely the reason Frame outlines—but it need not be pressed that way. “The Triune God is the Lord of history. Events in this world do not prescribe his being, or his tri-unity… all we know of the immanent Trinity is given in revelation, but revelation does not and cannot fully reveal God to human minds.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="giles"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Father of Jesus is the eternal Father of the Son, the incarnate Logos the eternal Son of the Father, and the sent Helper is the eternal Spirit of Father and Son. Human knowledge of the Trinity is not &lt;em&gt;exhaustive&lt;/em&gt;, but it is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. “God reveals himself as he truly is… the economic roles played by the three persons must be appropriate to their natures.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="subordination" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subordination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other serious challenge remains. How (if at all) should Jesus Christ’s human nature be taken to relate to his divine nature in considerations of the correspondence or identity&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the economic and immanent Trinity? The Incarnation reveals the relationship of Father to Son and Son to Father (as well as the relation of the Spirit between the two); then is everything that is true of the way that the Son/Logos-as-man related to the Father true of the way that the Son/Logos eternally relates to the Father? Or are there instead elements of the Incarnation which reflect Jesus’ human as well as his divine nature in relation to the Godhead? It is clear that Jesus the man subordinated his will to God the Father’s will, but it is not at all clear that this entails the eternal submission of the divine Son’s will to the Father’s will. Whether in liberationist theology or attempts to ground male-femlae relations in the ontology of the Trinity, any “radicalizing” approach tends to collapse the proper direction of the identity. It does not follow from the eternal distinction between Father and Son that the Father’s love for the Son is somehow greater than than the reciprocal love of the Son for the Father, or that the creative and redemptive acts of the Trinity in history reflect such a distinction.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moltmann"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it necessary in a logical or ontological sense that the Son and not the Father or the Spirit become incarnate? The answer is “yes”, but a carefully qualified yes. Creation, salvation, and eschatological restoration are each acts of the Triune God in which there is no confusion of that which is outside the Trinity and the inner Triune life itself.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:III.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Father wills, and through the Son’s action the Spirit effects. But in each of these acts, it is the Father &lt;em&gt;as Father&lt;/em&gt;, the Son &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;, and the Spirit &lt;em&gt;as Spirit&lt;/em&gt; at work.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:III.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only in the specific instance of Incarnation, but in all of history&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the economy of the Trinity reflects and proceeds from the essence of the Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; God freely acts in history in accord with his own being.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham rahner frame"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At the same time, the Incarnation—however climactic—is not the whole of God’s self-revelation. Equally important must be both the rest of salvation history and the apostolic teaching on the nature of the Son, which clarifies: there is &lt;em&gt;mutual&lt;/em&gt; submission within the Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It was fitting that the Son be Incarnate, and the Spirit sent; but more than this in terms of subordination should not be read into the relations of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the persons of the Trinity are not Father, Son, and Spirit in and of themselves, then Christians know nothing of the inner life of the God we profess to worship. The notion of Scripture as divine self-revelation is a sham. The actions of God in history do not reveal God himself. In that case, Jesus’ claim to reveal the Father would be more than suspect; it would be false. Moreover, it must have been the Son, the Logos, who was the climactic revelation of God (Heb. 1:3), and the Spirit who is the indwelling presence of Father and Son in God’s people. “The divine Word is the divine speaking. The divine gift is the divine giving.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:I.1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Pick one of these three areas and develop an argument for realism or anti-realism in terms of it. Don’t forget to assess the argument.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realism/anti-realism debate in science often hinges on the nature of and relationship between observables and unobservables. Anti-realists argue that scientists can have no actual knowledge of unobservables, and therefore should treat theories about unobservables agnostically: however useful the models may be, they should not be considered to correspond to &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; about reality. For example, anti-realists argue that hypotheses about the nature of fundamental particles such as quarks and electrons should not be taken as if quarks and electrons actually exist, but only as pragmatically useful, with no way even in principle of determining whether such things actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, any attempt to consider the relationship between observables and unobservables ultimately points instead toward a (critical) realist account of science. Any attempt to distinguish sharply or clearly in principle between observables and unobservables fails, for two reasons: first, the claim that “unobservables” as such exist in a strict sense; and second, that, the relationship between “observable” and “unobservable” falls along a spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first case, anti-realists use “unobservable” to mean anything not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; observable by human senses. However, to declare such objects in principle unobservable is to beg the question, since the point under debate is precisely whether things detected indirectly—electron traces in a gas cloud, for example—are being observed or simply hypothesized. Anti-realists must first establish in an in-principle sense a sharp distinction between that which is indirectly observed and that which is directly observed. Realists, by contrast, note that indirect observation is rightly considered reliable in the realm of ordinary experience. It is reasonable to conclude that the wind is blowing from seeing its effects on trees even if sitting inside a closed room with no direct experience of the wind. Indirect observations still count as observations, and are clear signals of the real presence of a thing being observed. Whether it is observed directly or indirectly does not determine whether it is observed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also extends into the second case: a realist view rightly makes sense of the way things are more or less directly observable. On one end are those phenomena which can be detected through (normal, healthy) human senses such as hearing or vision. Moving down toward the not-directly-observable spectrum, scientists use various sorts of equipment to enhance their ability to observe: telescopes, when looking at things inaccessible to ordinary human sight because of distance; and microscopes, when examining things inaccessible to ordinary human sight because of size. In both cases, however, there is no clear line distinguishing the “observable” and the “unobservable”—only a spectrum of more- or less-directly-observable phenomena. Insects may be observed with the unaided human eye, bacteria with optical microscopes, individual molecules of materials with electron microscopes. In each case, the same principle is at work in the observation: light bouncing off an object and being received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-realist may object that this is not so: the fact that the distinction between observables and unobservables is blurry does not mean it does not exist. To borrow an example from Okasha: the line between “bald” and “hirsute” may be fuzzy (pun intended), but it is still possible to identify a bald man. Even granting the in-principle distinction between “observable” and “unobservable,” however, the objection fails to establish the strong claim made by anti-realists. It does not establish that the items in question are in fact unobservable (especially when confronted with the realist argument for indirect observation). Nor does it establish that scientists would be in principle incapable of correctly modeling unobservables. At most, it establishes that unobservables may exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that though current models of astronomical behavior, or of quantum mechanics, or gravity, or any other only-indirectly-observable phenomena may be incomplete or partial, they nonetheless represent something &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;. The wind really is blowing. There really an electron leaving a trail in the gas chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

How do these defects point to a better model of scientific explanation?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘covering law’ model of scientific explanation is the view that scientific explanations consist of three elements: &lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt; arguments, with &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; premises, which make referent to (at least) one natural law. That is, for an explanation to count as “scientific,” it must first of all be in the from of an argument, “If A is true then B is the case; A is true, therefore B is the case.” Second, the premises of the argument must be valid. In other words, “If A and B are both true, then C is the case; A and B are true, therefore C is the case” is deductively valid, but if either of the premises A or B are false, the argument is not sound and it does not serve as a scientific explanation. Finally, the explanation must refer to one or more general laws in the course of its argument. That is, in the same formulation, “If A and B are both true, then C is the case; A and B are true, therefore C is the case,” the explanation may be both deductive and sound but &lt;em&gt;unscientific&lt;/em&gt; if neither A nor B are natural laws of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classic example of this sort of explanation is answering why a given plant died. Given that scientists know a great many things about the necessary conditions for plants to remain alive, it is possible to construct an explanation that fits the covering law model. Such an argument might proceed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All living must metabolize sources of energy to stay alive [general law GL-A].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plants are living things [observation O-A].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plants metabolize energy via photosynthesis [general law GL-B].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This plant was kept in the dark [an observation O-B].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, this plant could not metabolize energy via photosynthesis [conclusion C-A following from GL-B and O-B].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, this plant died [conclusion following from C-A, O-A, and GL-A].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would equally be possible in the absence of observations (O-A and O-B) to formulate a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt;: in place of O-B and the conclusions which follow it, we could supply this form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a plant is kept in the dark, it will not be able to metabolize energy via photosynthesis [P].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, a plant which is kept in the dark will die. [C-C]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the two forms are symmetric, because of the rules of deductive logic. Any explanation formulated under the covering law model could also be couched as a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the covering law model is initially attractive, there are two serious problems with it. The first is this very point of symmetry. Explanations, it turns out, are rarely symmetric with predictions. To borrow an example from Okasha, given the rules of trigonometry, if one knows any two of the angle of the sun in the sky, the height of a flagpole, or the length of the shadow cast by the flagpole, one can &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the third element. For example, having only the length of the shadow and the height of the flagpole, one can calculate the angle of the sun in the sky. Clearly, however, the length of the shadow and the height of the flagpole have no causal relation to the position of the sun in the sky. They do not &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; it, though they may be used to predict it. By contrast, the intent of the person fashioning the flagpole, and a combination of facts about the sun’s emanation of light as part of the process of fusion and the earth’s orbit around the sun do suffice to explain the length of the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not merely a hypothetical concern; it is precisely the distinction between ancient Babylonian and ancient Greek methods of astronomy, as J.P. Moreland comments. The Babylonian astronomers were able to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the positions of stars in the sky, relying on careful observation and detailed tables. They did not offer any &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; of those positions, however; the Greeks did. Though the Ptolemaic model the Greeks embraced is now rejected, it was an explanatory, and therefore &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt;, model. Predictions are not the same as explanations, precisely because explanations indicate the underlying causes that things are as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is possible to offer explanations which satisfy the covering law model, but in which the premises are &lt;em&gt;irrelevant to the conclusion&lt;/em&gt;. In Okasha’s example, a doctor explains why a man does not become pregnant in terms of the observation that people who regularly take oral contraceptives do not become pregnant, and the man is taking oral contraceptives. Leaving aside the question of why a man would be taking oral contraceptives, the actual explanation is quite different: the man does not become pregnant because men are biologically incapable of pregnancy. Though the argument is deductively valid, and its premises are at least potentially sound, the law actually fails as an explanation. In this case, its predictive power is actually deceptive, because the prediction is totally uncoupled from the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these failings share in common the same core issue: ignoring the role of causality. Scientific explanations—to be differentiated from scientific &lt;em&gt;observations&lt;/em&gt; such as “water is two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen”—traffic in &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; and not merely &lt;em&gt;predictions&lt;/em&gt;. Any model of how scientific explanation actually works must therefore include the arrow of causality.&lt;/p&gt;

Discuss two proposed solutions to this problem, and explain why (in your view) they are adequate solutions or defective ones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of induction is the question: &lt;em&gt;Is induction a trustworthy means of obtaining knowledge?&lt;/em&gt; The majority of scientific reasoning necessarily leans heavily on induction—it is, after all, impossible to observe every star in the universe, or every duck on Earth, or the psychological patterns of all humans, for example. Thus, any scientific reasoning which purports to rise to the level of a universal explanation or law must rely on induction to arrive at its conclusion: “We have observed things to obey rules X, Y, and Z in all known instances. Given the regularity of the universe, it follows that things obey rules X, Y, and Z everywhere.” The question is whether the leap between the premises and the conclusion is warranted: is it reasonable to suppose that things scientists have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; observed (whether because they are out of observational range, or because they are in the future) behave the same way as those they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; observed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lange helpfully summarizes the problem in the form of a simple argument: since all arguments are either deductive or inductive, the middle link in the argument for the reliability of induction must be either deductive or inductive. But it cannot be an inductive argument; that would simply be a circular argument: “If inductive reasoning holds, it is valid to use inductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning has always worked in the past, so we induce that it will continue to work in the future, ergo it is valid to use inductive reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the argument may also not be &lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt;. There is an infinite number of &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; possible explanations for the apparent success of induction to date. For example, it is logically possible that all objects believed to be green—and which inductive reasoning would therefore suggest will be green tomorrow as well—are in fact the mysterious and previous unobserved color “grue”: a color which appears green until an unspecified date, after which it is blue. This is just as logically consistent with all observations as the idea that induction holds. Thus, no deductive argument can demonstrate the validity of induction, for there is no &lt;em&gt;deductive&lt;/em&gt; manner of choosing between such possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proposed solutions is a pragmatic argument. &lt;em&gt;If the universe behaves uniformly, then induction will work; if the universe does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; behave uniformly, then no method will work. Therefore, scientists are justified in acting as though induction works.&lt;/em&gt; Unfortunately, this argument at best establishes a matter of reasonable policy for scientists, without providing warrant for belief. That is, however reasonable and even necessary it may be for scientists to proceed as though induction holds and is valid, the argument provides no evidence that induction &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; in fact hold.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is the argument from Christian theism: &lt;em&gt;given God’s creation covenant to maintain order (Genesis 9), the goodness and providence of God (derived from statements to that effect throughout Scripture), and the claim to efficacy of the Proverbs, it is theologically necessary that the universe continue to work as it has in the past.&lt;/em&gt; In its favor, this suggestion has the form of an argument, and is not directly reliant on the evidence of past uniformity as a basis for future uniformity. However, this sort of reasoning from Scripture is itself inductive. It takes a specific interpretation of the texts under consideration, and a belief that things are at a certain point in cosmological/theological history (i.e. the eschaton has not yet arrived) and extrapolates to the notion that God will continue upholding the previous pattern of laws of nature. Moreover, even if the argument were to hold, it would not be a &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; but a &lt;em&gt;philosophical-theological&lt;/em&gt; argument. (This is, perhaps, unsurprising given that though the problem of induction is especially applicable to the practice of science, it is a far more general problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, however, if the validity of induction is taken as an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; assumption, its historical efficacy may be taken as good evidence for the consistency of nature as a reasonable inference to the best explanation in the realism/anti-realism debate.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prayer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray. &lt;em&gt;Gracious Father: thank you for revealing yourself to us, especially in your Son, our Lord; and for filling us with your Spirit so that we may know you truly. As we come to your word tonight, help us know you more deeply and worship you more faithfully. In Christ’s name, amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please open your Bibles to Judges, chapter 3. And as you turn there, I want you to think about these words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boring exegesis &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be wrong when the texts are so obviously full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boring exegesis &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be wrong when the texts are so obviously full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s N. T. Wright, speaking of the Pauline epistles. But I think, equally applicable whenever we come to God’s word—especially in preaching and teaching—and most especially when the texts are like this one: lively, to say the least; strange, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two goals for this sermon. The first—always the first—is to show the grace of God clearly. As Bryan Chappell, the author &lt;em&gt;Christ-Centered Preaching&lt;/em&gt;, puts it, we want to see how God did for his people then what they could not do for themselves; and through that to be be reminded of what he has done for us, that we could not do for ourselves. That’s the point of this sermon: God’s grace in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But secondarily—thinking about boring exegesis; thinking about hard texts like Judges 3—I hope to encourage you that these texts, these strange texts, these sometimes difficult texts—they’re for us, and for our good. They’re for our people, and our people’s good. We don’t need to ashamed of them, or embarrassed by them, or intimidated by them. Rather, we can come away seeing how these texts magnify the grace of God, how these texts remind us to look to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="body" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="othniel-the-first-judge" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Othniel: The first judge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s look and see. This is a long passage, with three judges—Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar—so we’ll take each in turn. Read with me, starting in verse 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first narrative is probably the easiest to understand. &lt;strong&gt;Othniel&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;the first judge&lt;/strong&gt;. He is the prototype for all the other judges that follow. His story shows out the pattern for the whole book, the same one the author laid out back in chapter 2: sin, discipline, a cry for mercy, and God’s deliverance through a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 7: Israel sins. They &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt; Yahweh their God. They served the Ba’als and the Asheroth instead of the God who had delivered them from Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an interesting word choice: &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt;—and it’s an important word, not only in this passage, but throughout the Bible. After all the reminders in the covenant: Set up these stones so you remember! Teach your children, so they remember. Bind it on your hands and your forehead, so you remember! And they forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Othniel is Caleb’s brother, note. They forgot in the &lt;em&gt;first generation&lt;/em&gt; they were in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we forget, we get things wrong. You’ve seen it happen: a spouse forgets an anniversary, and spends some time “in the dog house.” Or parents who miss a school event for their children, and leave them feeling like they don’t matter. Forgetting a friend’s birthday: maybe you’re not as close as you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes… we all forget who God is, what he has done for us, and what our relationship to him is as the covenant people of God. We find ourselves fixated on the approval of the people in the pews, on the applause of subscribers to our popular podcast, on the affirmation of our professional peers. We become idolaters—just like Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he showed them mercy. How? “He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia”—not mercy the way we might be inclined to think of it, but real, deep mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because: see what happens? It had the intended effect. They remembered Yahweh and called out to him. And he delivered them—both from the pagan King, and from their idolatry, at least for a time! The Spirit came on Othniel, and he led Israel to war, and God delivered them from Cushan-rishathaim, and they had peace for forty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God delivered his people, and Othniel, this &lt;em&gt;first judge&lt;/em&gt;, was a good judge. He wasn’t a prophet like Moses; he didn’t give them lasting rest, any more than Joshua had (40 years is good, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;); and he didn’t circumcise their hearts. Not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; judge then. A good judge, but not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ehud-the-assassin" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ehud: The assassin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, he was also the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of the Judges. Things only go downhill from here. Who’s next? &lt;strong&gt;Ehud: the assassin.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s read again, picking up in verse 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he commanded, “Silence.” And all his attendants went out from his presence. And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat. And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them. When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.” And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. And he said to them, “Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the same pattern again here… sort of. We see Israel sin, and God discipline them. And we see Israel cry out to their covenant God, and we see him deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, Ehud’s story is more complicated than Othniel’s was. Some of the details here might initially perplex us. Why do we hear about how fat the king is? Why do we hear about the dung coming out after he gets stabbed? Why almost any of the extraneous-seeming details in this story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is satire. (Which doesn’t make it untrue, of course.) The author plays up the ridiculous elements in this bit of history to make a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we see here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conquering king! …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who’s actually morbidly obese, not exactly a strapping warrior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who, so cunning he could forge an alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites, gets fooled by a simple trick (“Oh king, I have secret message for you”)—he’s either hopelessly naive or profoundly overconfident; neither is good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a man who so comically out of line with what a king should be that his servants don’t even notice when there’s a wretched stench and he takes a &lt;em&gt;looong&lt;/em&gt; time relieving himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his servants? They aren’t exactly top-drawer. They don’t even notice Ehud escaping after he assassinated their king…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we read the story right, it’s humorous. The author is poking fun at the Moabites! “Those Moabites!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, wait… those Moabites conquered Israel. This ridiculous Moabite king?… Ehud was there to bring him tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel&lt;/em&gt; is the real joke. The idolaters who got conquered by &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; king. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what good satire does. It sneaks in, makes you laugh, and then hits you where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about Ehud himself? What about this savior figure? He’s not good either. He’s a vicious assassin, a traitor who stabbed the man he was legally supposed to be serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is messy. Not just because of the dung coming out. But because while yes, God did deliver his people, and that is good—but Ehud isn’t the kind of deliverer we want, not the kind of deliverer we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the brutal killer, but the one who was brutally killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the one who defeated a foreign king by stabbing him in the gut, but the one who overcame both the pagan oppressor and the idolatry that led to that oppression by &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; stabbed, by taking the weapon to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Judges shows us over and over again what we’re like left to our own purposes. How even our human saviors are woefully insufficient. The covenant hope, proclaimed from the start of Genesis and made so clear in Deuteronomy… was still waiting to be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="shamgar-unifying-theme" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shamgar &amp;amp; Unifying Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we come to the end of this chapter—to &lt;strong&gt;Shamgar: the man with an ox-goad&lt;/strong&gt; and his one verse: verse 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re like me, you’re wondering at least two things about this passage. One is: what in the world is an oxgoad? That’s the easy one: It’s a cattle prod. A long wooden pole with a point on the end. Makes for a decent improvised spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other question, the bigger question, is &lt;em&gt;why does Ehud get paragraphs, with lurid details for a satire… and Shamgar gets just one sentence?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a man who, based on his name, doesn’t even seem to be an Israelity, who shows up, kills 600 Philistines with an ox-goad, and then he’s gone. He gets one mention in Deborah’s song in chapter 5, but basically, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why mention him at all if he’s so seemingly unimportant? Why these proportions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this is the inspired word of God. And the author had a reason for giving us these stories, even &lt;em&gt;these proportions.&lt;/em&gt; He’s making a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read this and I, for one, think, “Oh, that sounds interesting; how did he do that with a cattle pr—” “NO. That’s not the question.” He slams the door on that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamgar’s skill with an ox-goad is not the point, any more than Ehud’s skill as an assassin was the point, any more even than Othniel’s skill as a military leadership was the point. No more, I put it to you, than any of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; are the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And he also saved Israel.” Those words tell us what we need to know. Who saved Israel? Shamgar… Ehud… Othniel… but really, in every case, Yahweh. The covenant-keeping God, who saved Israel not only from 600 Philistines, not only from a Moabite king worthy of derision, not only from a mighty king of Mesopotamia—but from her idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary-and-exhortation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary and Exhortation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday—someday, after many judges, many kings, many priests, many prophets—there would come a deliverer—a judge, a prophet, a priest, a king—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would give the land rest, who would give the people of God true rest, for more than just a generation; forever…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would be a wise king&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would be gentle and gracious ruler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would give God’s people circumcised hearts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who would fulfill the covenant hopes and take on himself the covenant curses of Deuteronony, of Exodus, of Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have that deliverer. We have Christ. “And he also saved Israel.” So when we read, when we teach, when we preach, let us look, every time, and see what God did for his people that they could not do for themselves. Let us, in every passage, in every picture of grace, find a reminder of what God has done for us in Christ, that we could not do for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a deliverer. Don’t forget. Don’t let your people forget. We have a deliverer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gracious Father: thank you for delivering us. Help us be faithful with your word. Help us remember, and help us remind your people, of how you have delivered us. In the name of Jesus, our savior, amen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good evening. Let’s pray before we begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gracious God, may your word be clear in our hearts. May your Spirit open our minds to see you more clearly and love as you have loved us. May we see you, and may I not obscure you. Thank you for revealing yourself to us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our text for this evening is Philippians 2:1–11. It might be a familiar passage to many of you, but I think it might also be a surprising passage to you. It was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if you’ve ever been walking along someplace familiar and had something prompt you to stop and notice something about your surroundings that you had never seen before. Maybe you went back to the house you grew up in, and the house is the same, but you aren’t—and you notice the little cracks in the ceiling. &lt;em&gt;Were those always there?&lt;/em&gt; You look at the wall in your older sister’s bedroom. &lt;em&gt;Was it always that color? I thought it was lighter than that.&lt;/em&gt; You go down the stairs into the basement, and “Yup, they always creaked like that,” your mother tells you. You start to ask about the way the basement smells and she just shakes her head at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I read this passage, and it kind of felt like thinking you had grown up in a &lt;em&gt;really nice house&lt;/em&gt; and going back and discovering that it was &lt;em&gt;mansion&lt;/em&gt;. But whether you’ve read this passage a hundred times, or this your first time opening a Bible, God is inviting us into a beautiful mansion tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="believers-called-to-humble-selfless-unity-215" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Believers called to humble, selfless, unity (2:1–5)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we come to Philippians 2, Paul has just spent the first chunk of a letter to these Christians in Philippi—good friends to him, people who have supported his ministry—about his circumstances… which aren’t great, frankly. He wrote this letter from prison. But, one way or another, he has seen a great many people hear the good news about Jesus as a result of his in prison. But he also knows that the Philippians are having a hard time, and he knows that they need encouragement in their faith. He knew that when things get hard—whether that’s persecution, physical or mental illness, death among your friends or family, losing jobs—when life gets hard, we can turn on each other. And Paul called the Philippians, in the midst of their trials—God is calling us, tonight, in the midst of our trials—to something different: to a &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;section id="four-reasons" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four reasons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul opens with four &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; for people to live with this humble, selfless unity. “If there is any…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encouragement in Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comfort from love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;participation in [which could also read fellowship in or with] the Spirit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affection and sympathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is any,” he says. Is there any? Well, yes. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; encouragement in Christ. We &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find comfort from being loved, by God and by each other. As believers, we do have fellowship with the Spirit, and through him with Christ and the Father, and of course with each other too. We do have God-given affection and sympathy for each other, and even for non-believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Paul is using that “if” to quietly point the Philippian believers to a &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. When he asks them to complete his joy if these things are true, he’s saying, “Look, these four things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; true.” You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; encouragement; comfort; fellowship; affection and sympathy. And just as they did, so do we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given those four good reasons, Paul asks them to complete his joy. As he has told them already, earlier in the epistle, he already has great joy—in seeing the gospel go forth. He even rejoices when people preach the gospel in an attempt to make him jealous. But his joy isn’t complete without something else. If these four reasons are the foundation for that completion, the finished building is &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;. But what we might ask: what is the structure of that finished building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="three-ways" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Three ways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three. Four foundation stones, and three pillars on that base. Paul told his friends they would complete his joy—they would fill it up—by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being of the same mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having the same love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being in full accord and of one mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re worried about my counting: affection and sympathy go together, and so do “being in full accord and of one mind.” If you have true affection for someone, you will feel sympathy for her when she is struggling. If you’re in full accord with someone, it’s like you and he share a mind. So: four foundation stones, and these three pillars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we see in these three pillars is that these three ways are really &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way. They’re one structure. And that &lt;em&gt;one way&lt;/em&gt;, is to be &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;. That one way is &lt;em&gt;unity&lt;/em&gt;. Joy, for the apostle, and I think it is fair to say God’s joy in our fellowship, is complete when we are truly unified. Not identical, but unified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we have the same mind? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; do we have the same love? &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; can we be in full accord and of one mind? That seems rather abstract. If I sat down my three-and-a-half year old and my 20-month old and said, “Okay, Ellie and Kate, you need to have unity between you two,” they would just stare at me. Ellie, the older one, might say, “Yes, daddy!” just to be good, but they wouldn’t know what to do with it. Kate, the younger one, would probably yell “No!” because she’s a toddler and we’re working on that right now. And wherever you are: whether you’re saying, “Okay…” but you don’t really get it, or you’re saying “No, no way! Have you met these people?” Paul draws us forward. He gives us some help, makes it a little more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="two-contrasts" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Two contrasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul gives us two pairs of contrasts to help us see a little more clearly what this kind of unity looks like. Capstones to match the foundation, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Do nothing [, he says in v. 3,] from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the first capstone, the first contrast. Not selfish ambition, not conceit, but humility, and counting others more important than yourself. So we see first that this unity is &lt;em&gt;humble&lt;/em&gt; unity. It comes becomes I’m valuing you above me. I’m not trying to exalt myself. I’m thinking of how I can make you do well instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verse 4 shows us the second contrast, the second capstone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unity, then, is also &lt;em&gt;selfless&lt;/em&gt;. When we’re healthy, we don’t just aim to get our own. “Looking out for number one!” No, instead, we help others accomplish their hopes. We give of our time; our money; our sleep; our space – to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the church. This is the kind of building we’re supposed to be. As Paul puts it in Ephesians, we’re being built together into a temple for God—a temple of people known for their &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;—their love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have these four foundations: encouragement in Christ, comfort from love, fellowship with the Spirit, and affection and sympathy. We have three pillars of unity: being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. We have two capstones: calls to humility and selflessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you might be asking now, “How? I want that unity; I even want to be selfless and humble, even if that sounds kind of hard. But I don’t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.” And to that, Paul says, “Don’t worry; I’ll give you an example. In fact, here is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; example.” And he shows us Christ—verse 5: “Have this mind among yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-foundation-of-humble-selfless-unity-2611" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The foundation of humble, selfless, unity (2:6–11)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind of Christ! That’s a heady thing to think about. But for Paul, it’s deeply practical, in fact. He gives us a very succinct summary of Jesus’ ministry. And what was Jesus like? He was humble. He was selfless. (And if you’re thinking, “But what about unity?” you’re right. Hold on to that thought. We’ll come back to it.) Let’s start by looking at Christ’s example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="christ-humbled-himself" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Christ humbled himself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;who [Christ Jesus], though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped [—something to be held onto—], &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see here is one of the great mysteries our faith. God became man. We could take a dozen sermons on this point alone. But Paul has something very specific for us to see from the Incarnation here. Whatever prerogatives we might have—whatever money, whatever fame, whatever position or status—the Son had more. And Jesus Christ lived as a servant. He didn’t hold onto what was his (and it really was his, by right!). He came as one of us. When you read here, “in the likeness of man,” don’t think “he was kind of like us.” Hebrews tells us that he was &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; was we are—yet without sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that degradation goes down and down and down. He became a baby, who needed to be changed. He dealt, like my older daughter does, with younger siblings who tormented him. He was teased by other children. He went through puberty and had his voice go all scratchy. He worked for many years in obscurity. When he started his ministry, he was rejected as often as accepted, loved for his miracles and not for the God he revealed, mocked even by his own family, and wandered around without a home. Remember, the God of all the universe. And ultimately, he died. Died a sinner’s shameful death. He took our humiliation. And through all of it, he did not complain, he just served. So Christ is our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convicting model, at least for me. Jesus, the real flesh-and-blood Jesus who was tempted just like us, is the perfect man. He is what it &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; to be human rightly. And he served. He’s the rightful king! And he served. Do I serve like that? Do you? Or do we demand our rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-father-exalted-christ" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Father exalted Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as we come into these final verses, we see what at first might seem like a bit of a strange turn. Paul is trying to teach us about this kind of &lt;strong&gt;humble, selflessness,&lt;/strong&gt;—and yes, &lt;strong&gt;unity&lt;/strong&gt;. Hmm. And we were tracking along, as we saw the concrete example of Jesus living and dying selflessly. Feeling conviction, even; I certainly was and am. But then we get to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, at first blush, a bit of a challenge. “Okay. I mean, it’s good that Jesus is exalted. But how does it fit? Am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; going to be exalted? Am I supposed to serve because Jesus was exalted? What’s going on here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to this. One of them is, yes, that Jesus is Lord. We are citizens of his kingdom, and if his people lived like that, his people should &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; live like that. So that is one part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something else going on here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this—oh, this! What do we see here? We see the Father exalting the son. He &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; exalted him. He gave him the name that is above every other name. The Father wants every one to say, “Jesus is Lord!” The Father wants everyone to bow down and worship Jesus. And Jesus, the Son—he’s doing all of this, he’s becoming a servant, taking on human nature, dying, on a cross to what end? To the glory of the Father!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a little glimpse here into something… &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;. We see the Father, saying to the Son, “Let me exalt you!” And Jesus says to the Father, “All the glory is yours!” And the Father to the Son, and the Son to the Father, back and forth, and back and forth, forever. This is the life of the trinity. This is the eternal life of the triune God: &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;! Love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what we’re meant to be. This is what the church is for. This is what &lt;em&gt;humanity&lt;/em&gt; is for: men and women made in the image of God—&lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of the Trinity, in the life of the church. This is the building we’re meant to be. This is the temple. This is the mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul has taken our question: “How do I live like that?” and he’s answered it by showing us how the life of the triune God took on flesh, and lived among us. Was our servant. Died for us. He says: “How Christ lived is how we are meant to live.” And he reminds us, back there in v. 1: “If there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit—any fellowship with the Spirit, remember; any affection and sympathy, complete my joy…” We have fellowship with the Spirit. That’s where our unity comes from: not common interests, not shared experiences, not being the same age, or sex, or ethnicity, or social standing, or economic status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re meant to be a little picture, every day, of the Trinity. And the way we do that, is by living like Christ did. We choose, every day, to serve the people around us, instead of ourselves. We choose, every day, not to put ourselves first, but to put others first. We choose, every day, not to make ourselves look great, but to love others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exhortation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exhortation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers and sisters, here is my challenge to you today. Fill up your joy, and fill up my joy, and fill out our Triune God’s joy in you!—by loving one another as he has loved us. This kind of &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt; is not a burden. It is what we are for. And yes, in this fallen world, it is hard sometimes. But we have the Spirit. We participate in God’s own love. Mystery— awesome mystery! Let us love one another. Let us count one another more important than ourselves. Let us look not only to our own interests, but to each other’s. Let us live in the &lt;strong&gt;humble, selfless, unity&lt;/strong&gt; of our King’s kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And friend, if you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a believer, and you look at this picture, I hope you’re thinking, “Yes. That’s what the world ought to look like.” Because it is. And it’s beautiful. We’re not meant not for self-absorption. We’re meant to live like Christ did. So I challenge you: call Christ lord. Let his death be yours, and his resurrection, too—come walk after him with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pray to our loving, selfless, humble God of unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;God we praise you, who are love and light forever. Thank you for your love—for sharing it with us, humbly and selflessly; for drawing us into your love and restoring us to what you designed us for. Thank you for building us into a temple for your Spirit. Help us walk in this same humble, selfless unity. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

If, at some point in the future, I actually deliver this sermon (e.g. in my sermon delivery course next semester), I will update this post with a link to the audio and/or video.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent estimates suggest that the United States of America currently spends about three times as much money on our military as the next biggest military spender out there, China. In fact, if you add up the military spending of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Great Britain, India, and Germany, we still spend more. And remember, China’s and India’s populations are both over four times larger than ours. What’s more, corruption and graft notwithstanding, our military-industrial complex is incredibly advanced. It’s fair to say that America has the most powerful, best equipped, most effective military apparatus in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet. And yet, as a country, we are very afraid. All of that power can’t protect us from everything. And we are very feared. For all of America’s lofty ideals, we have made a mess of things pretty often. We’ve gotten it wrong. Having power, it turns out, isn’t enough. Having enough power matters, but so does having the right kind of power, and so does how you use that power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at Mark 5:1–20, we’re going to see that play out. It’s not just having power that matters. It matters who has the power, and how they use it. Do they torment? Or do they show mercy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you a hint: we want power coupled with mercy. You can see, if you look at verse 19, how this whole passage hinges on that. When all is said and done, the man in the middle of this story gets to go tell all his friends and neighbors how much the Lord had done for him—how powerful God is—and how the Lord had shown him mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exposition" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see how Mark gets us there. As we come to our text, we read: “They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other side of the sea from what?” you might be asking. Well, from Galilee, where Jesus had been teaching. Back at the beginning of chapter 4, Mark tells us about a series of parables that Jesus taught about his new kingdom. And those parables particularly emphasized people’s response as his kingdom comes. Some reject it entirely; some look excited about it at first, but ultimately aren’t a part of it; and some, a few, &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; citizens of the new kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, back in 4:35, Mark switched to a series of narratives—four stories. This is Mark’s basic strategy: tell us what Jesus said, and then show us what he did. Why? Well, because the parables weren’t just cryptic things Jesus said to confuse people; he was telling his disciples, the ones who had ears to hear, how things really were. Each thing Jesus &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; showed that what he &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His kingdom wasn’t coming the way people thought, or even to the people who thought it was for them. And he wasn’t the kind of king they had in mind, either. He had authority not just over nations and troops, but (as Mark shows us in these four stories), over the sea and the sky, over demons—that’s today’s passage—over incurable illness, even over death. And in each of these events, we see that Jesus wasn’t just a &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; king. He was also a &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt; king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, within these four narratives, Mark breaks things down into two pairs of miracle stories which hang together: the storm and the demonized man, and the two healings back on the other side of the sea. Today, we find ourselves in the second half of that first pair. With the storm, the disciples could not save themselves, so Jesus rebuked the storm, and there was a great calm, and the disciples were afraid. We are going to see those same ideas here: someone who cannot save himself, Jesus rebuking something, a great calm as a result, and people being afraid. We will see Jesus’ power and mercy. And we will see a different response than fear—a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-1-a-wild-man-516" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 1: A wild man – 5:1–6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s follow Mark on this journey. Verse 2 tells us that “when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit”. Verse 6 reiterates the point—“And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him”—but first Mark wants us to know something about who this man was. Verses 3 through 5 tell us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was not a man in need of a little help, an appointment with a counselor. No, here we have a man enslaved. Nothing anyone could do would help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have here is Mark establishing both the characters involved, and the “power curve” for the rest of the scene. If you’re reading a superhero comic or watching a superhero movie, you have a sense of how strong everyone is. And of course, this leads to all sorts of conundrums. Who would win in a fight? Next year’s &lt;em&gt;Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/em&gt; both hinge on this. Who is stronger? Who will win? And of course, if you let the wrong characters in, the game just becomes pointless. I saw an interview with the writers behind &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt;, where they explained why the Hulk wouldn’t be in the movie. You add in the Hulk, and it’s game over for the other team. There’s no tension in the conflict anymore. The Hulk just wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s basically the picture Mark shows us in this passage. It’s pretty clear: the demons were stronger. Nothing anyone could do was effective. They couldn’t even keep this man imprisoned; verse 4 has him acting like, well, like the Hulk. They tried chaining him up hand and foot; he just ripped the chains on his wrists off and smashed the fetters on his feet. “No one,” Mark says, “had the strength to subdue him.” Healing him was out of the question. And the man himself was clearly totally under the demons’ control. The “super-villains” had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Hulk can be kind of fun to watch, but that’s not what we have here. They made a mockery of this man. We shouldn’t take that lightly. They made him run around screaming, naked, cutting himself, in the midst of the tombs. There is a reason Mark describes him as having an &lt;em&gt;unclean&lt;/em&gt; spirit. The demons were doing everything in their power—short of killing this man—to defile what God had called “very good” and what he had promised to redeem: his humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s the power curve when Jesus arrives on the scene; there are the characters. As soon as Jesus gets off the boat, this man comes out to meet him. And then, perhaps surprisingly, given that power curve—but then again, maybe not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; surprising given what Jesus has already done in this gospel—verse 6 tells us that the man falls down at his knees before Jesus. He goes prostrate. Flat on his face. The way you would kneel before someone absolutely more powerful than you. Jesus’ arrival is clearly a change from the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2-a-merciful-act-5713" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 2: A merciful act – 5:7–13&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;section id="setup" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mark has set the scene for us: here is a man who has been tormented for who knows how long, and as soon Jesus steps off the boat, he man comes running up and throws himself down at Jesus’ feet. That’s quite the welcoming party. Put yourself in the disciples’ shoes for a moment. You’ve just seen Jesus go from sleeping in the back of a boat—in the middle of the kind of storm that scared the Galilean fishermen who are with you—to standing up and telling a storm to be quiet and it does. You’re afraid. And then you get to the other side, still more than a little in shock from that, and a naked man with cuts all over his body comes up to Jesus and throws himself at his feet and starts arguing with him, shouting at him. You might be afraid all over again. And for good reason. Notice that throughout the whole passage, the disciples are just onlookers. This is out of their league, too; so they just watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2a-jesus-power-5710" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beat 2a: Jesus’ power – 5:7–10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the man and his impure spirit is not, however, out of Jesus’ league. Verses 7–10 make it very clear that Jesus is absolutely and unquestionably the most powerful person in this encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, too, that the demonized man is arguing with Jesus because Jesus is arguing with him. Verses 7 and 8 tell us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!” For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus picked this fight, and it’s not going to go down well for the demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know from ancient records that there were both Greek and Jewish exorcists who made it their business to drive out evil spirits. You will find the same in many non-Western cultures today, and—as an aside—I think those cultures probably have the right of it more than we do. It has been said that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn’t exist, and that seems about right. How can you possibly fight something you don’t even believe exists? It’s a brilliant, devious strategic move. You can pull the North Korea strategy—try to constantly rattle your saber to keep everyone afraid of you. Or you can act like an assassin: keep a low profile, and if possible don’t even let your would-be opponents know you exist, until you’ve killed them and caused mayhem. In the hyper-secular West, that seems to be the satanic strategy of the hour, and I think it’s fair to say it’s been reasonably successful for our enemy—even if we know from passages like this one that Jesus’ ultimate victory is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; the strategy of the day back then, though. And we know from those old records that the general strategy for dealing with demons was to try to use powerful command words and phrases, or to negotiate and bargain, or to use the demon’s name to get spiritual power over them, or to try to use other divine powers to bind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t see any of that in this passage. The demons recognize Jesus’ power and authority right away. You can see it there in verse 7: as soon as Jesus tells them to leave, they plead with him not to torment them. And you don’t plead with someone not to torment you unless they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; torment you. By the time Jesus asks for a name in verse 9, the demons have already acknowledged Jesus’ power and authority in the situation. What’s more, they call him “Son of the Most High God” there in verse 7. Now, this title does double duty here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is another confirmation of Mark’s claim throughout his gospel: that Jesus is in fact the Son of God. And significantly, the early confessions to that effect all come on the lips of demons he exorcises. The spiritual forces know spiritual authority when they see it, even if the people don’t see it yet. So confirming that Jesus is “the Son of God” is the first thing this does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing it does is establish that Jesus isn’t just another player in the spiritual game. Whatever other gods someone might worship, and whatever other claims to divine power someone might offer up, Jesus trumps them all. He is the son not just of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; god, but of &lt;em&gt;the Most High God&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is a legion of demons, as they admit in verse 9, simply heightens the contrast. We knew already that the “impure spirit” was able to torment the man; now we know that it is &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; demons. It doesn’t matter. They’re still reduced to begging and pleading with him: verse 10 tells us that the man—really, the spirits speaking through him—“begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the power curve: Jesus’ authority isn’t even in the same ballpark as anyone else in the story—not the demonized man, not the people who were unable to help him or even restrain him, not the silent disciples, and not even the multitude of demons. He exceeds them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-2b-jesus-focus-51113" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beat 2b: Jesus’ focus – 5:11–13&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ power is only part of the story, though. As we come into vv. 11–13, we can see his &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; as well. And that focus is healing a man in need. Read with me, starting in verse 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this confirms what we already know: they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; Jesus’ permission. He is in charge. But, second, it also tells us that between the man and the pigs, there wasn’t a contest for Jesus. Not because he didn’t care about pigs. We know from Colossians 1 that the eternal Son of God—who Mark is taking this whole book to tell us about—is the agent of God’s creation of the whole universe; and his powerful word is the reason that the whole universe keeps existing, pigs included. Pigs were part of what he called a “good” creation in Genesis 1. Speaking as a lover of bacon myself, I’m inclined to agree with God’s assessment: pigs are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, and this is important: people are more important than pigs. You can find any number of modern commentators on this passage asking about the ethical implications of Jesus’ letting the demons destroy the pigs along with themselves in this way. Neither Mark nor Luke or Matthew seem bothered by this point. Neither does Jesus. Pigs matter. Pigs are good. But they don’t matter like people do. And while it is not clear from this passage why Jesus accepted the demons’ request, what is clear is that his mercy toward this man—his compassion on him—trumped any concern for the pigs. Jesus’ focus was healing and saving people. Here, we see clearly that his powerful word is not just for creation, but also for &lt;em&gt;salvation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us something about Jesus’ power and authority. It is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; power and authority. He is &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt;. And it is so important—&lt;em&gt;extraordinarily&lt;/em&gt; important—that the Son of the Most High God, the king bringing in his kingdom, be merciful. Because as Ephesians 2 tells us, before God intervenes in our lives, we’re all like this man was. We start off dead in our sins, slaves to our lusts and every desire gone wrong and totally unchecked, in the domain of darkness, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit now at work in the children of disobedience. The demons, in other words. And then Jesus steps in. As the rightful king, he has the power to free us… and he’s a &lt;em&gt;merciful&lt;/em&gt; king, so he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; free us. That’s good news. That’s gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-3-a-fearful-crowd-51417" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 3: A fearful crowd – 5:14–17&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it doesn’t always &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like good news to everyone when Jesus shows up and starts healing people. Remember, Mark is showing us the truth of those parables from back in chapter 4. So we see here the good king who is bringing in his kingdom—in secret now, but someday in glorious light—but we also see those different kinds of soil from the parable of the sower and the seed: some fruitful, some &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at what happens in verses 14 through 17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine being one of the herdsmen, seeing the pigs drowned by demons, and being frightened—and maybe they were. But that’s not what Mark says. That’s not why these people were afraid. They were afraid because they saw this man who had been naked, clothed; who had been running and screaming, sitting calmly; who had been out of his mind, now in his right mind. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was what made them afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark has created a sharp contrast here: between this scene and the one that preceded it, the calming of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see Jesus confronting something far more powerful than ordinary humans can handle: in the first, a terrible storm; in the second, a legion of demons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see him exercise his powerful word for mercy: in the first, to save his disciples from the storm; in the second, to save this man from the demons who tormented him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In both scenes, we see the tumult of a broken world, and then calm and peace after Jesus acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in both scenes, we see people who are afraid after Jesus acts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there seems to be more than one way to be “afraid” when you see the power of God’s Spirit on display in the person of Jesus Christ. You can be afraid and still want to be with him, like the disciples. Or you can be afraid like these people were—they wanted him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, one of these is better than the other. Far better to be with Jesus even if his power is more than you can handle—even if you find that the Son of God is not at all safe. Because he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="beat-4-an-effective-commission-51820" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beat 4: An effective commission – 5:18–20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mark wants to take us even further than the disciples’ example. He wants us to see that we do not need to be afraid. Because Jesus’ &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; is expressed in &lt;em&gt;mercy&lt;/em&gt; to his people. The disciples didn’t really understand who Jesus was yet, didn’t really grasp either his power or his mercy yet, but someone surprising in this story does: an unclean Gentile man who had been tortured by demons. The man Jesus healed. The one to whom he so very powerfully showed mercy. Look! Verse 18:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He begged! He is the third person to beg or plead in this story. The demons begged not to be destroyed yet—and Jesus surprisingly showed them mercy in that. The people pleaded with Jesus to leave—and Jesus surprisingly showed them mercy in that. And here—at last!—someone begs for the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing: to be with Jesus. The same phrase as when Jesus called the disciples to be with him. And Jesus surprisingly… shows mercy by saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to him. Verses 19 and 20:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go home to your own people”, verse 19 says—some translations say “to your friends”—“and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has mercy on you.” Precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; this man understood Jesus great power and his great mercy, he had somewhere to be that wasn’t &lt;em&gt;with Jesus&lt;/em&gt; yet. He knew how great God’s power was, and he knew how deep God’s mercy was. So Jesus gave him a commission, and it looks familiar: go tell the nations what God has done. The nations: this is a Gentile, not a Jew; he is in the Decapolis, Gentile country, not Jewish country. “Go tell them about God’s mercy,” Jesus says to him. Because the mercy of God is not just for the Jews. Jesus was not going to be a petty little messiah, king of a corner of Palestine. God’s mercy was for the healing of the nations. And here we see the first taste of that in Mark—because what happened? “…all the people were amazed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark doesn’t tell us here what came of this, what the fruit was. We don’t know how many of those who were amazed were just apparently fruitful soil, where the seed sprung up and soon withered. But it is clear that there was at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; who was good soil. And if Jesus’ ministry in the Decapolis in chapter 7 is any indication, it seems the Spirit may well have been using this man’s seed-sowing to prepare a great harvest some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing to see here: a detail, but not a little thing. Unlike the disciples, who hadn’t &lt;em&gt;gotten it&lt;/em&gt; yet—this man proclaimed &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what he should have. Notice, Jesus tells him to say what “the Lord” had done for him. From a Jew, including Jesus, that meant “Yahweh,” the God of Israel. And in verse 20, “the man went away and began to tell… how much &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; had done for him.” And rightly so. The mercy of Yahweh, the God of Israel, is the mercy of Jesus, the Son of the &lt;em&gt;Most High God&lt;/em&gt;—the God over every pagan deity, over every demonic power, over every human heart, over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, John Piper was preaching a missions sermon, and he started with Mark 5:19. You can see why. It’s the heart of the gospel. And Piper summed up the heart of the gospel this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God sent his Son into the world to save sinners from every nation so that they would glorify him for his mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s right. This whole narrative is a microcosm, a little picture, of the gospel, and of the right response to the gospel. Here we have a story of a Gentile man—one of the nations, not a Jew—who was literally enslaved by the powers of hell, set free by Jesus. But not just set free; set free and given a commission. Look there at verse 19 again: “Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.” That commission tells us what this story is about. And the center of that commission is the center of Mark’s gospel. And in fact, it’s the center of the whole Bible. It’s the center of this &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; story we are all part of. God’s power, expressed in mercy, to save people from every nation through Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look how much he has done for us &lt;em&gt;because of that mercy&lt;/em&gt;! He saves people like you and me, people from every nation who can’t save themselves, and he invites them into his kingdom, and he gives them a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="invitation" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, he gives &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; a mission. If you are a Christian in this room—if you have said to Jesus, “Let me be with you”—then he has said to you, “Go and tell your friends how much the Lord has done for you and how he has shown mercy to you.” Every one of us should want others to know how God has saved us. If you aren’t doing that, I challenge you: tell the people around you! Tell your friends, your coworkers, your family members. If that’s hard for you—and I understand; it can be—then think back on your salvation. Think about how God has shown mercy to you. Pray for the Spirit to stir you up, to deepen your love for him and your joy in what he has done, so that your telling others isn’t out of guilt, but out of excitement. That’s a prayer he delights to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And friend, if you are in this room and you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the kingdom? We have a good king, who offers you a pardon for your rebellion. You can be a citizen with us; we were all rebels, too. Come to him. Ask to be with him. Join us as we follow him. He has shown us mercy; he will show you mercy, too. All you have to do is surrender. Lay down your weapons. Ask for mercy. And call him Lord. If that’s you, please: let us walk with you. Come talk with us before you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pray. Let’s pray to our powerful, merciful God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

T. Wright, Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996, 741 pages. Reviewed by Christopher Krycho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books can claim to represent a substantive entry in both apologetics and hermeneutics, yet this is precisely what N. T. Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Jesus and the Victory of God&lt;/em&gt; accomplishes. In this book, the second in Wright’s massive work on Christians origins,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he treats the question of the historical Jesus via a thorough survey of the modern history of interpretation and the contents of the synoptic gospels themselves. The result is a telling well within historic Christian orthodoxy, though often at sharp angles to current historical approaches to Jesus. Along the way, he also marks out a fruitful interpretive path for Christians reading the gospels. The picture he paints of Jesus—a first-century prophet-Messiah who saw himself standing at the capstone of Israel’s history, fulfilling Yahweh’s plans for his people, but in a way no one in his day seemed to expect—is both apologetically compelling and spiritually illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright begins with an introduction designed to orient the reader to the basic challenges confronting any would-be interpreter of Jesus in the modern era. Critical issues abound, and it is impossible to return to a pre-critical reading of the text. But though the historian must deal with any number of problems in interpreting the person of Jesus, these problems are not specific to him; they are endemic to the task of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright therefore begins by establishing his criteria for evaluating interpretations of Jesus’ person and program. Any such theory must account for the transition from Judaism to Christianity; it must therefore present Jesus, the lynchpin of that transformation, as not only &lt;em&gt;dissimilar&lt;/em&gt; to both worldviews, but also &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to both (132). Jesus must have made sense to his Jewish contemporaries, but also profoundly theologically innovative, to create an entirely new community with its own theology and practice. Wright argues Jesus accomplished this via a program in which “[the] symbolic world of first-century Judaism has been rethought from top to bottom, even while its underlying theology (monotheism, election, and eschatology) has been retained” (218)—with Jesus himself at the center of the plan of Israel’s god, uniquely embodying a father-son relationship with &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues this thesis in two major parts, one focusing on the work and teachings of Jesus as a messianic prophet, the other focusing on the Jesus’ aims and beliefs as he carried out his program. Along the way, Wright examines a wide and representative sample of Jesus’ reported deeds and teachings. In each case, the data fits the thesis: Jesus was retelling Israel’s story in a new way, with himself at the center of God’s plan to end his people’s long exile. By the end of the volume, Wright can thus conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Jesus] believed himself called, by Israel’s god, to &lt;em&gt;evoke&lt;/em&gt; the traditions which promised &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return to Zion, and the somewhat more nebulous but still important traditions which spoke of a human figure sharing the divine throne; to &lt;em&gt;enact&lt;/em&gt; those traditions in his own journey to Jerusalem, his messianic act in the Temple, and his death at the hands of the pagans (in the hope of subsequent vindication); and thereby to &lt;em&gt;embody&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return. (651)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple restatement of typical Christian belief, though of course it accords with it. It goes further, making sense of Jesus’ words and deeds in a way that meets Wright’s criterion of double dissimilarity and double similarity. The thesis passes the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="assessment" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s volume has much to commend it: its historical method, its thoroughness, its broad engagement with opposing views, even its style. Its most significant contributions, though, fall under two basic headings: a challenge to many modern (atheological or even anti-theological) re-readings of the gospels, and a challenge to many current evangelical interpretation of the gospels. Both of these are successful in large measure because of Wright’s care (and flare) in dealing with the material and with other (contrary) treatments of the same data, but it is Wright’s ability to build cogent arguments with that material on this scale which makes this more than a tedious summary of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against secular, demythologizing, and materialist interpretations of the text, Wright mounts a serious and substantive case for a traditional (though not uncritical) assessment of the historical reliability of the synoptics and their picture of Jesus. Many critics suppose that the picture of Jesus painted by the gospellers must be anachronistic, ideologically-driven or situationally-motivated, or inflated by faith in contradistinction to history. Such readings of Jesus paint him as any variety of figures: a sadly-mistaken apocalyptic prophet; a Stoic philosopher in first century garb; a preacher of progressive ideas of love and tolerance; the author of a new, non-Jewish religion; a preacher of Jewish (or timeless) verities. One suspects, with Wright, that many of these readings find their source not in the text but in the prejudices or preferences of the commentators. Wright’s argument, by contrast, is far more credible than any of these—and not simply because it aligns with the historic confession of Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Rather, his picture of a distinctly Jewish apocalyptic prophet makes the best sense of the actual evidence from the earliest texts, including not only the synoptic gospels but also the early epistles and even the non-canonical literature like the Gospel of Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major value of the book is its (usually, but not always, quiet) challenge to many &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; readings of the gospels. Wright accurately notes that many Christian interpreters, perhaps especially in the Protestant tradition, have struggled to make sense of the gospels. Many evangelical readings of the gospels find little or no connection between what Jesus said and did and his crucifixion and resurrection. Indeed, no few of the commentaries this author has read sturggle to make much of the Pharisees’ and Sadducees’ mutual hostility toward Jesus without reducing them to caricatures, or to make sense of many of the parables or their role in Jesus’ ministry. The interpretation Wright proposes accounts for all these issues, and provides a helpful hermeneutic for untangling many of the otherwise perplexing passages in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work thus walks a helpful middle ground between misinterpretations on either side. Anachronistic tendencies among both secular and Christians interpreters lead both astray. He was not a modern progressive, nor an unfortunately mistaken apocalyptic street preacher, nor a teller of timeless ethical truths, nor a preacher of a new religion of grace oddly disconnected from Judaism. Rather, he was a Jewish prophet going about the business of offering a subversive interpretation—though one deeply in touch with the Law and Prophets—of &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s promises to his. This is unsurprising. After all, this is precisely how the gospels present Jesus: dissimilar in certain ways from both the Judaism that preceded him and the Christianity that followed him (again: Wright’s criteria of double dissimilarity). Any telling of the historical Jesus must provide an explanation for the transition from Second Temple Judaism to Christianity, and do so on historically plausible grounds. So must any right interpretation of the gospels for Christian piety. Wright’s theory accomplishes this handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more important is the way in which Wright’s work strikes at a kind of nascent docetism among many Christians. While Jesus’ full humanity may be an article of faith for orthodox believers, many fail to think of what exactly that means. Jesus was not merely as a divine mystery speaking timeless truths and then fulfilling a cruciform commission strangely disconnected from his parable-telling, paralytic-healing ministry. Rather, he was a &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; standing at the conclusion the line of Jewish men who had called Israel back to faithfulness and proclaimed that Israel’s God was about saving the whole world. Not only does Wright have a Chalcedonian Christology, he is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; orthodox than many believers: the Jesus painted in this portrait is no less human than divine. Jesus’ sense of vocation, his real temptations and struggles to fulfill that vocation, and even his not-rare, but unconventionally-embodied, claim to Messiahship were the actions of a first-century Jewish &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;. To see this clearly is to see exactly what the Fathers meant in their confession of “our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and manhood, truly God and truly man… consubstantial with us according to the Manhood, in all things like unto us, without sin…”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To miss it is to risk missing the humanity of Christ in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application-and-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application and Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work is to be commended on a number of levels. Its scholarly depth makes it a formidable resource when discussing the historical Jesus, particularly with those who reject the gospels’ claims to present Jesus accurately. Wright’s enjoyable wit makes the length of the work far more manageable. His proposed hermeneutic, though it can be pressed too far, provides a helpful tool for interpreting the synoptics. Most of all, his reminder of the real and true humanity of Jesus is a sharp rejoinder to the functional docetism all too common in evangelicalism. The book is therefore very helpful for both apologetics and exegesis. Whatever their other differences with Wright, pastors and teachers would do well to digest Wright’s work here.&lt;/p&gt;

Azurdia III spent several decades preaching and pastoring. He was thus well-experienced in the week-to-week work of preparing sermons and the burden of caring for a congregation. During his years of pastoral work, however, he also studied at Westminster Theological Seminary; he was at the time of the book’s publication a professor at Western Seminary. Thus, he also brought to the table academic knowledge helpful for situating his developing understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in a preaching ministry. Accordingly, Azurdia brings both Scripture and experience to bear in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt;: the lessons he learned in seminary, he then applied in the context of his ongoing ministry, and was able to filter his experience through careful reflection on the Scriptures. &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; was published not at the beginning of that career, but after considerable time behind the pulpit of an ordinary church, after he had moved into a teaching role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia’s aim in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; is twofold: to demonstrate the necessity of the Holy Spirit’s work in the preacher for effective preaching, and to describe how the preacher should go about seeking the Spirit’s work in his preaching. He argues in his introduction that “the greatest deficiency in contemporary expositional ministry is powerlessness; in other words, preaching that is devoid of the vitality of the Holy Spirit” (12). That is, although right preaching necessarily entails careful exegesis and attention to the “literal, grammatical, historical, contextual, redemptive” details of a text (11), no amount of mere intellectual study on its own will accomplish God’s purposes for preaching. If the church is to be encouraged, challenged, and built up; and if outsiders are to be convicted, the Holy Spirit must be present and working efficaciously through the preacher. Only the Spirit can change human hearts. This was true for the early church, and it is true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia lays out his thesis in a brief introduction. Following that, he does not simply repeat the thesis chapter by chapter, however. Instead, he builds a broader theology of preaching and connects the different elements of the preaching ministry back to the central theme of the text. Thus, in Chapter 1, he starts by arguing that the “greater works” the disciples would do were the advancement of the gospel through the nations, and notes how Christ explicitly tied this to the coming of the promised Holy Spirit. The advance of the gospel was for the disciples, and is for modern preachers, utterly dependent on the work of God. Chapter 2 describes who the Spirit is and what he does in the life of the minister—and what goes wrong in the ministry when the Spirit is neglected. In Chapter 3, Azurdia argues for Christocentric preaching, since the Spirit is &lt;em&gt;Christ’s&lt;/em&gt; Spirit and glorifies him. Chapter 4 carries this theme further: the priority of every preacher must be glorifying Christ, not merely meeting the felt needs of the people. Every topic must be heard in light of the finished work of the Savior, not standing on its own as abstract ethical instruction. In Chapter 5, he argues that the first responsibility of both the minister and the church is preaching—and that, as such, the church should understand when the pastor spends most of his time preparing for sermon delivery, rather than on other concerns. Here he also takes time to critique ministry methodologies which do not align with the gospel, especially those in many seeker-sensitive churches which have run to extremes of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 6, Azurdia comes to the core of his message: the preacher must be both generally filled with the Spirit (i.e. regenerate) and specifically filled time and again by the Spirit for preaching. Here he draws upon the frequent language of being “filled with the Holy Spirit” in Acts as well as the affirmations of preachers like Martyn Lloyd Jones. Chapter 7 is an examination of the flip-side of the necessity of the Spirit’s filling: the frustration of the pastor’s own inability. If the work of the Spirit is utterly essential for preaching to have any effect whatsoever, then all the pastor’s efforts may be for naught. This may lead to either despair (for the self-dependent man) or greater faith (for the man who trusts Christ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 8, Azurdia turns to the nature and life of a man called to this ministry: he “&lt;em&gt;must devote himself to a consistent pattern of fervent intercession&lt;/em&gt;” (135, emphasis original). That the Spirit must be present for preaching to be effective is not grounds for pastors to abdicate their own responsibility. Rather, it increases their responsibility to pray for the Spirit to work through their preaching. Chapter 9 continues this focus on the life of the preacher. He must be prayerful, diligent in study, and prayerful in his study. He must remember in all this prayer that the Spirit is not a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; but a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, someone who can be grieved. The preacher must keep himself holy, and so must his congregation—because either may drive away the Spirit by their unrepentance. Chapter 10 illustrates and emphasizes this necessity of prayer in the life of both preacher and congregation. Finally, Azurdia briefly summarizes his argument: “&lt;em&gt;Spirit empowered preaching is the principle means of advancing the kingdom of God…. will be evangelical in emphasis…. is the responsibility of the church&lt;/em&gt;” (179–181, emphasis original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is persuasive and thorough, but neither as effective or as persuasive as it might have been. Azurdia’s comments on the “greater ministry” the disciples were to have are perhaps the most helpful material in the book. In general, his attention to the roles the Spirit plays in the life of the church is a helpful corrective both to the neglect the Spirit often receives from non-charismatic churches and the misinterpretations proffered by many in the charismatic movement. Likewise, his call to prayerful as well as well-studied preaching is a helpful reminder especially for preachers tempted to rely on their own intellectual merits. Gladly, and unlike E. M. Bounds’ work on prayer, he does so without ever denigrating the value of intellectual engagement and deep study. Azurdia’s counsel to study hard, pray hard, and pray during the time of study is well-taken. Those who preach should devote meaningful parts of their preparation time not only to exegesis but to fellowship with God by &lt;em&gt;prayerful&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Azurdia’s emphasis on the nature and person of the Spirit. As noted above, he refuses to indulge in the mistaken charismatic emphases on the miraculous gifts over the more central work of the Spirit: revealing Christ. All the focus on sign gifts can quickly lead people to forget that the Spirit was sent to make Christ known and glorify him. His diagnostic question is extremely helpful (and not only for evaluating charismatics, but for evaluating anyone claiming God’s hand on his ministry): “&lt;em&gt;Does this ministry reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/em&gt;” (50, emphasis original). Again, the Spirit is the spirit of truth, sent by the Father to empower the church to know and make known the Son. As such, no ministry which claims the Spirit’s power but focuses on anything other than knowing and proclaiming Christ is legitimate. At the same time, this does not mean the church should shun the Spirit to avoid those missteps—rather, the church should point to a better understanding of the Spirit’s mission, and respond in faith. A church that understands the Spirit’s proclamatory and instructing role will follow Azurdia’s counsel and dedicate itself to prayer, cognizant that apart from the Spirit the church and her pastor can do nothing. Congregations should also learn to ask that same question of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sermons and preachers and experiences: does it reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, weaknesses emerge in a number of areas which substantially lessen the book’s impact. First, Azurdia makes the same move many Reformed and evangelical preachers do, elevating the preaching of the word to the primary (and nearly the sole) responsibility of the preacher. This move seems unwarranted in light of the distinction between ordinary pastors and the apostles on whose actions (in Acts 6) the view is grounded. As such, Azurdia simply passed over the many other responsibilities enjoined of shepherds in the pastoral epistles. To be sure, preaching is a necessity in the life of the church. However, it is only one of the pastor’s responsibilities, and he will find it difficult to carry it out effectively if he is not sharing life with his sheep. Thus, pastors ought to dedicate much of their time to &lt;em&gt;shepherding&lt;/em&gt;: to caring for the ordinary soulish needs of their people and not only for the times of preaching. This is doctrinally necessary, and practically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More problematic was Azurdia’s conflation of the Spirit’s filling with an experience or sense of that filling. Like Lloyd-Jones and others he cites, Azurdia describes the anointing or unction of the Spirit as a particular sense the preacher and congregation have of the Spirit’s working through him in a unique way. Curiously, Azurdia also affirms that there may be times the Spirit is moving powerfully but the preacher is unaware of it, as in the common case of a man who preached and felt it accomplished nothing but heard later from members of his congregation how the Spirit used it in their lives. Too often in evangelicalism, &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; is mistaken for &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. Nowhere in the New Testament is the Spirit’s presence described in terms of a feeling in the preacher. Rather, it is born out by the effects of the preaching. To be sure, the Spirit may graciously grant the pastor a clear sense of his presence and power on some days, and that sense is a blessing. However, the absence of such a sense does not indicate the Spirit’s absence; neither does a strong feeling necessarily indicate his presence in power. In encouraging pastors to think in these terms, Azurdia ultimately plants seeds of discouragement in the lives of those who may preach diligently and prayerfully—and effectively—for many years without that particular experience, which is promised no one. As he notes of many experiences in charismatic circles, “we need to be concerned that the spiritual development of well-meaning Christians can become vulnerable to the law of diminishing returns… Often, the inevitable consequence is spiritual emptiness” (49). This is no less a danger for the preacher expecting a strong internal sense of anointing than for the believer wanting a fresh anointing for speaking in tongues. Preachers should indeed dedicate themselves to prayer and come with an expectation that they can accomplish nothing on their own, but they should reject as unbiblical and unhelpful the idea that their internal sense of the Spirit’s presence is accurate or indicative of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, on the whole, Azurdia’s point is well-taken. The church desperately needs the Holy Spirit for her efficacy in ministry. Lives will not change unless God works: sermons will fall on deaf ears, and congregations’ ministries may produce physically helpful outcomes while leaving sinners damned. Preachers and their people must recover prayerful dependence on the third person of the Trinity. They must ask constantly of their ministries, “Does this show Christ clearly and make him look glorious?” They must plead for the Spirit to come and work. But (contra Azurdia) they must never mistake their perceived experience of the Spirit for the actual work of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books are as perplexing to modern readers as Revelation, and few matters within it as controversial as the nature of the millennium. As one commentator put it, “Judging from the amount of attention given by many writers to the first ten verses of chapter 20, one would think they were the single most important section of the book of Revelation.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The three major millennial readings—pre-, a-, and postmillennial—divide on how to read the sequence. Both amillennial and postmillennial interpretations affirm that Christ will return at the end of the millennium and that there will be a single resurrection, whereas the premillennial interpretation anticipates Christ returning to &lt;em&gt;inaugurate&lt;/em&gt; the millennium, raising (some or all of) the saints at that time and then raising all who remain at the end of the millennium for final judgment. This paper will argue that John did not in fact intend to establish a totally new doctrine of a millennium (of any sort) in this much-debated sequence, but rather intended to succor his audience with the hope of God’s faithfulness to his promises. That is: the millennial passage indicates not a duration of time—not even an indeterminate sequence as in some idealist or historicist readings—but rather depicts symbolically and numerologically the fulfillment of the promises made to the saints elsewhere in Revelation and the rest of Scripture. In particular, he draws on imagery and the recapitulatory pattern established in Ezekiel 37–48,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presenting the same conflict multiple times from different angles to emphasize the sovereignty of God and the surety of his salvation and vindication of his saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation was most likely written by John the Apostle from exile on the island of Patmos in the early-to-mid-90s A.D., though it is impossible to be certain of either authorship or provenance.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The churches which constituted John’s audience—the seven addressees of the letters that opened the book—were facing a history of persecution and the threat of future persecution. As early as the 60s A.D., the church had faced serious persecution under Nero, and it continued to face varying degrees of opposition in the years that followed. The book served then—and has served the church ever since—as an exhortation to endure and an encouragement that whatever trials come, God will accomplish justice in the end and vindicate his saints.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the purpose of the book is thus relatively clear, it remains difficult to interpret because of outstanding questions regarding its genre and structure. The book opens and closes in epistolary fashion; it declares itself to be a prophecy; and it is explicitly titled an apocalypse and bears all the hallmarks of the genre.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with many apocalypses, and like the Old Testament prophecies on which it is modeled and from which it draws, the book functions not merely as revelation, but also (and perhaps primarily) as exhortation—thus the epistolary frame and the consistent thematic warning against idolatry.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with apocalyptic literature in general, the book is heavy on imagery, metaphor, and symbolic representations. As such, it conveys its message at the three distinct levels of &lt;em&gt;visionary&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;referential&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Leaping directly from the visionary to the referential level without considering the symbolic meanings will certainly lead to misinterpretation within the genre. Indeed, the book itself indicates that it conveys its message primarily through symbols.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, right interpretation of the text must respect literary convention and take care not to leap from the content of John’s vision to a proposed referent without considering how symbolism may be at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The millennial passage does not stand alone, but is part of the final, conclusive judgment cycle, beginning in 19:11 and concluding at the end of chapter 20. The sequence is comprised of five “And I saw…”&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequences, which begin in 19:11, 19:17, 20:1, 20:4, and 20:11. The millennium itself is introduced in 20:2–3 and discussion of the millennium carries on through the final defeat of Satan after his release “when the thousand years are ended” (20:7).&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After God’s final crushing victory over Satan, the scene turns to eternal judgment at the great white throne. Throughout the entire final sequence, he draws heavily on the narrative, language, and imagery of Ezekiel 37–48. Thus, John’s cycle of judgment passages leads directly into a discussion of the new Jerusalem, just as Ezekiel’s judgment sequence leads into his lengthy treatment of the future, eschatological temple.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finally, John synthesizes these images from both Ezekiel with eschatological language from Isaiah, combining the two great visions into a unified whole. This pattern, and the imagery layered throughout, should both caution the reader from interpreting the sequence in strict chronological fashion—Ezekiel’s treatment is expressly recapitulatory&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and suggest that John’s intent may be comment and synthesis rather than the formulation of a wholly new doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-the-beast-and-the-false-prophet" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:11–21: A Climactic Battle with the Beast and the False Prophet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John opens this final section of the book with two visions. The first (19:11–16) is an image of Christ as the divine warrior, the Word of God, whose word destroys the enemies of God. The second (19:17–21) is of the defeat of those enemies and a horrifying feast—the dreadful inverse of the wedding supper of the Lamb.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is the first of several significant clues that the millennial passage that follows &lt;em&gt;recapitulates&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt; this battle. Throughout the book, with the sole exception of the appearance of nations in glory in the conclusion, “the nations” (τὰ ἐθνῆ) appear to the rebellious nations in contrast with the saints&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and the nations are &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; destroyed here. The beast and false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire (19:20), and “the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse” (19:21). The deceived nations that join Satan in Satan in his post-millennial war must be understood in light of this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-millenniumsatan-bound-saints-reigning-with-christ" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:1–6: The Millennium—Satan Bound, Saints Reigning with Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 20:1–3, John describes an angel binding Satan and locking him in an abyss for a thousand years. In vv. 4–6, he describes the “first resurrection” and the thousand-year reign of the martyrs-and-saints with Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the one hand, the language used here for binding Satan seems fairly strong: the angel binds him, then shuts him in the Abyss and seals and locks it.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, this is not the first place where the New Testament speaks of Satan’s being bound (cf. especially Mark 3:27 and the parallel in Matt. 12:29, Luke 19:17–18, John 12:31, Col. 2:15).&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nor is it the first place where angelic forces defeat Satan and restrain his power (cf. Rev. 12).&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The angel binds Satan, and the point seems to be the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;efficacy&lt;/em&gt; rather than the &lt;em&gt;extent&lt;/em&gt; of the binding: to prevent Satan from deceiving the nations and from assaulting the saints, until the climactic final battle.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It also establishes God’s rule: Satan is powerless to resist.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After describing Satan’s binding, John turns his attention (another “and I saw”) to saints sharing in the first resurrection. Notably, these saints are seated on thrones, and John has used the language of martyr-saints and thrones before (see 6:9ff).&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The word “throne” appears some forty-seven times in the book, and apart from references to Satan’s or the beast’s rule, all of them (save perhaps these) unambiguously refer to heaven, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; earth.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The link strongly suggests that the scene is not the earth in some future age, but heaven, and reinforces the notion that John is recapitulating material he has covered before, rather than continuing sequentially from what preceded in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s language of the “first resurrection” (20:6) and the ingressive use of preterite ζάω, “They came to life…” and “the rest… did not come to life” (20:4–5) are perhaps the strongest arguments in favor of a premillennial reading of the passage. The language suggests bodily resurrection, and indeed it is unusual for the same word to be used first of spiritual and then of physical resurrection only a few phrases apart.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, there are reasons within the text itself to think this is not John’s point. The first resurrection here includes all of, but only, the righteous; and the second all of, but only, the unrighteous.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, and more conclusively, the &lt;em&gt;second death&lt;/em&gt; that parallels the (implied but never mentioned!) second resurrection&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is at least primarily spiritual, while the first is clearly physical; it is therefore possible the inverse is true of the resurrections.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The kind of “coming to life” on display here is thus not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; final resurrection, but spiritual life in the interval between Christ’s comings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the literary tenor of the passage warrants caution beyond even that already suggested by the apocalyptic setting. The passage is saturated in symbolism and imagery: “chain,” “key,” “Abyss,” “dragon,” “ancient serpent,” “locked,” and “sealed” are all certainly images representing realities, rather than literal depictions of those realities.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given ten’s association with completeness or perfection, the use of its third power is clearly symbolic as well.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, John here draws on imagery that was already prevalent in the apocalyptic literature that formed the context of his audience’s expectation. The notion of a Messianic millennium was not his invention, though he did bring it to bear in a unique context within the Christian canon.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To suggest, then, that these “thousand years” &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be taken as a literal depiction of time, regardless of how often John repeats it, is to mistake the literary context and John’s intended meaning.&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; the numbers in Revelation appear to have a figurative rather than literal referent.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed, any directly literal approach to the millennium is necessarily “an incredible way to treat numbers in an apocalypse!”&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a symbolic reading of the thousand years seems best—and not only in the sense that the time period in view is not literally one thousand years, but also in the sense that it points to something other than a physical reign of the martyr-saints on earth entirely. One of the functions of the millennium, on any reading, is to demonstrate both Satan’s and the nations’ lack of repentance. Neither does a thousand years of being restrained chasten Satan whatsoever, nor does that interval where Satan is restrained change the hearts of rebellious men and women.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Both Satan and rebellious humanity vindicate God’s judgment against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-satan" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:7–10: A Climactic Battle with Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not itself a distinct section,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the final war with Satan recapitulates material already covered in Revelation 16–19, and also links back to both of the immediately preceding “and I saw” sections.&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is one of the major clues that John is not building a theology of the millennium: the climactic defeat of Satan here directly echoes the previous defeat at Armageddon (16:14) and the defeat of the beast and false prophet (see above).&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed “the war” (ὁ πόλεμος) appears only here, at 16:14, and 19:19 in the book, further tying them together.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As noted above, the nations were utterly destroyed in the battle in 19:17–21, yet appear again here as Satan’s pawns only to be destroyed completely again. Even commentators who suppose a basically premillennial outlook therefore grant that the sequence of events with the nations here is difficult to make chronological sense of in premillennial terms.&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is the same battle, with the same enemies, and the same outcome. John is indeed following Ezekiel’s outline; like the prophet, he retells the same battle from two angles. Just as the beast and false prophet deceived the nations and led them to destruction, Satan deceives the nations only to lead them to destruction. Indeed, this serves as the conclusion to a large-scale chiasm running from the beginning of ch. 12. John introduces Satan, the beast and the false prophet, and Babylon, and in turn God judges Babylon, the beast and the false prophet, and finally Satan.&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome is as expected, in light of the rest of the book and especially the preceding section it so clearly echoes. There, Christ defeated the Beast and the false prophet utterly; here God defeats Satan utterly. No actual battle appears in either case: God’s and Christ’s victory is immediate and without contest.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Satan’s deception comes to an end once and for all, every one of his tools (whether the harlot, the false prophet and the beast, or the rebellious nations of the earth) unable to stand before God.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As in Ezekiel, the rebellious nations are destroyed in the first telling with a sword, in the second telling with fire.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Likewise, the end of Satan’s deceptions of the nations culminates in his being thrown into the lake of fire, just as were the other deceivers in ch. 19.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The millennium is not a sequence &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; the war against the saints, but a second image of the time that &lt;em&gt;leads up to&lt;/em&gt; that final confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="after-judgment-then-consummation" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;After: Judgment, Then Consummation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Satan’s defeat, the living and the dead are judged, and those whose names are not found in the book of life are subjected to the second death—this one spiritual, joining the beast, the false prophet, and Satan in the lake of fire. Notably, the dead who are judged have not gone previously to the lake of fire here—unlike the rest of the New Testament’s expectation that the dead will be judged immediately at Christ’s return.&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the last, Death and Hades join them (just as in 1 Cor. 15:26).&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: these are symbolic images; the visionary content cannot be translated into future-historical referents directly and without interpretation. These conclusive events &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; help resolve the point of the millennium itself, though: they align all the final judgments together, synchronize John’s telling with the Ezekiel narration he is interpreting. Thus, John turns immediately after the judgment to the final vision of the book: the New Jerusalem, and the new Heavens and new Earth, and the descent of God to dwell with humanity forever. As in Ezekiel, the focus is on the shape of the future temple, as a symbol of the perfect restoration of God’s place of fellowship with humanity—only magnified manifold even beyond Ezekiel’s vision. Further, John’s integration of Isaianic imagery here into the new Jerusalem/heaven and earth strongly militates against interpreting Isaiah 65 as pointing to a millennial age.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to this massively perfect garden-city-temple emphasizes the finality of God’s eschatological work. It also further demonstrates that John’s concern, unlike so many commentators, was not the establishment of a doctrine of a millennium. Rather, John sought to make clear that God’s victory would be final and complete, that justice would be done in the world, and that the saints would have the reward he promised them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="concern" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may err—indeed, &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; erred—in several ways in its interpretation of the Apocalypse. One the one hand, she may swerve into the kind of sensuousness attributed to Papias and others early in the history of the church, prompting Origin and Augustine to take a purely spiritual reading of the millennium, with the Reformers following them. On the other hand, the church has sometimes carried this idealized reading into spiritualizing away Christ’s return. Neither of these are good. John’s millennium is not a literal thousand years, nor even an unspecified-but-lengthy period of time when the former saints reign in resurrected bodies on a still-fallen earth, with sin yet-unjudged, over others who are still mortal and can reject salvation.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But it is not a throwaway idea, and it should not lead the church to mischaracterize &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; elements of John’s eschatology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John uses this language not to outline a new eschatological doctrine, but to shine light on an old one: God’s work overthrowing the powers of the present age in his Messiah’s incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. He reiterates what he and others have already said: Satan’s power to deceive the nations has been broken, because the strong man came and bound him.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christ is reigning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 1:3–4), though there is a greater reign yet to come. Moreover, the broader context of the book makes clear that John’s point here is not to suggest some future half-way stop between fall and glory. Rather, he assures saints that even now, Satan’s hatred and lies are restrained—however fierce they may seem at times. As such, the saints can stand fast in the face of whatever trials they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major implications of this reading for the life of the church. First, and foundational for the second, Revelation as a book and this passage specifically have something to say to the church &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. These are not merely vague notions about an unknown future, which confuse rather than comfort. Instead, they are a symbolic (but for that no less &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;) proclamation of the reign of Jesus Christ, the Ancient of Days, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who will one day let Satan loose only to destroy him and his evil utterly. Secondly, therefore, the church should &lt;em&gt;preach&lt;/em&gt; this book, and regularly. John’s promises about the future will lead the church now to stand fast when the surrounding world calls for compromise and the temptation to idolatry rears its head, as it does in every generation. Satan is bound; Christ reigns &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, and the saints with him; and someday Christ will come again, judge the living and the dead once for all, and consummate his kingdom. “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus” (Rev. 14:12). The indicative—Christ reigns, Satan is bound—prompts an imperative: life as if this is so!&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Come temptations to materialism, or the worship of ancestors, or nationalism, or any other idolatry, Christians proclaim Christ alone is Lord. —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identity of the martyrs/saints is primarily significant for premillennial readings.

While this division is tragic, it does rightly reflect the importance of the issue, reflecting as it does on central issues including a church’s or denomination’s Christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology. It is both important enough to divide over, and central enough to warrant ongoing effort to reconcile over. However, to either rightly divide or rightly reunite, believers must have a clear understanding of the issues at stake in the discussion, as well as the Biblical, theological, reasonable, and traditional bases for those reasons.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three major questions confront the church regarding the Lord’s Supper: &lt;em&gt;What is it?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Who may administer it?&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Who may receive it?&lt;/em&gt; The first question is a matter of Christology and sacramentology; the second and third questions are ecclesiological, but depend on the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="christology-and-sacramentology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christology and sacramentology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic Catholic view, &lt;em&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/em&gt; is the idea that in the Lord’s Supper, the body and blood of Christ become truly, physically present in the elements—not in their physical makeup, but in their ontological reality.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Protestants have frequently characterized this view as a &lt;em&gt;re-sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; of Christ, in which the priest sacrifices Christ again. The actual Roman Catholic view is not a &lt;em&gt;re-offering of Christ&lt;/em&gt;, however, but a &lt;em&gt;re-presentation of Christ’s offering&lt;/em&gt;. Put another way, when the priest offers the sacrament, the congregation mystically participates in the once-for-all action that Christ accomplished at the cross in time and space.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Granting that the Protestant characterization accurately reflects popular Catholic piety regarding the Mass—but just as Protestants would not wish to be judged on the worst excesses of their own traditions’ popular piety, so they should interact with the best of Catholic thought and not only its worst extremes.) Catholics further believe that God provides grace to aid the believer in life and to save from the power of sin by taking the mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lutheran concept of the Table is different from the Catholic position, but nearer it than most other Protestant views. Luther rejected many elements of Roman Catholic &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of the mass, along with the Catholic doctrines of transubstantiation and re-presentation.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, he insisted that Christ’s body and blood were nonetheless physically present in the bread and wine. In support of this view, he leaned heavily on the language of the words of institution, “This is my body… this is my blood…” The simple declaration he took to be a clear indication of &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;signified&lt;/em&gt; (as Zwingli argued in their debates). That is: “the body and blood of Christ are received through the acts of eating and drink… the consecrated bread &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his body and the consecrated wine &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his blood.”&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Many) Lutherans are thus inclined to take the Reformed view (see below) as of an “&lt;em&gt;unreal, fictitious&lt;/em&gt; presence” in contrast with a real, “&lt;em&gt;corporeal&lt;/em&gt; presence.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variations in the Reformed tradition, most prominently Zwingli’s memorial view and Calvin’s “real” or “spiritual” presence view. Of these, Calvin’s is the most distinctive and the most widely practiced apart from Zwingli’s view, and is the dominant view among orthodox/Westminster Presbyterians. Calvin argued that Supper is a gift from God the Father, which points to Jesus Christ, as the Holy Spirit makes Christ really present to believers.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He took the words of institution to indicate that Jesus really is present with believers in the feast—“the incarnate, risen and ascended Jesus Christ along with the grace that God promises.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For Calvin and his successors, the bread and wine are really bread and wine, and these untransformed elements are themselves part of God’s gift.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, this view takes the words of institution as more than mere sign-language; it affirms that through the Spirit believers are truly partaking of Christ himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the dominant view among Western evangelicals is that the Supper is symbolic or memorial only. First articulated by Zwingli and championed by the Anabaptists and Baptists in the centuries that followed, this approach has its adherents among nearly all present-day free-church denominations and non-denominational churches, including the majority of Baptists and charismatics (of all “waves”). There is no single view among Baptists or other low-church evangelicals (Pentecostals or other charismatics included), since they have no single binding authority, whether ecclesiastical or confessional.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nonetheless, some standard contours do emerge: baptist theologians tend to emphasize that the grace of God is specially present, but only in the same ways it is specially present in preaching, fellowship, or other normal means of grace. On the other hand, common piety regards the supper as purely symbolic, having no gracious content whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Popular views among charismatics may modify this somewhat, however, by including the idea of healing at the Table, as an act of the Spirit for the gathered church.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ecclesiological-practice" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecclesiological Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all major traditions partake of the Lord’s Supper as gathered churches—not in individual or family settings (though there are of course exceptions). While some denominations and organizations also practice the Eucharist in parachurch contexts, this is the exception rather than the rule.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Catholic church offers the Mass daily: as the supreme sacrament and primary means of grace in the life of a Catholic believer, it must be taken frequently. Lutherans, most Reformed churches, Anglicans, and Methodists generally take the Supper weekly, usually as the climax of the Sunday service. By contrast, most other low-church evangelicals—whether denominationally affiliated or not, and whether charismatic or not—come to the table much less frequently. There is no typical pattern among such groups. Taking the supper as rarely as once or twice a year is not unheard-of, taking it weekly is rare, and monthly or quarterly perhaps the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various demoninations’ restrictions on the Table vary significantly. The Catholic and Orthodox generally restrict the Table to those in communion with their traditions. Some (though by no means all) Lutherans and Reformed similarly bar from the Supper those who do not share their particular confessional stances.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Among the free church traditions, practices vary widely. On the one hand, many modern baptistic churches practice fully open communion&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a practice that has deep roots in the tradition, dating at least to the practice of John Newton’s church. On the other hand, the majority of Baptists historically and many today argue for closed communion, where only believers baptized &lt;em&gt;as believers&lt;/em&gt; (and usually by immersion) may take communion.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Across all traditions, advocates of more “open” communion emphasize that it is a universal church institution that emphasizes Christ’s work on behalf of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; believers, while those in favor of “closed” communion emphasize the importance of the elements that do separate the denominations—not least their Christology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="spiritual-presence-practiced-regularly" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spiritual Presence, Practiced Regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions are commendable for their attentiveness to the words of institution, there remain substantial problems with both their views. The Roman Catholic emphasis on priestly mediation of the mass obscures Christ’s all-sufficiency as mediator; likewise, the language of re-presentation of Christ’s sacrifice obscures the finality of Christ’s act on the cross. The Lutheran view recognizes no distinction whatsoever between sign and thing signified, and it hangs on the interpretation of the crucial “is” in the words of institution, ironically without regard for how language (sign) may convey something other than than bare sense (signified). Meanwhile, purely symbolic/memorial views fail to give due attention to either the seriousness of Christ’s words at institution or the ways in which God has always mediated his grace through physical signs and symbols. The language of both Old and New Testament ordinances is more than merely figurative: God really did something in the sacrifice of sheep and goats, and he really does something in baptism, church discipline, and the Eucharist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin’s “real presence” view seems the best of the options. It maintains the immensity of Christ’s proclamation of his presence, but without insisting on a view of that presence that diminishes his corporeal ascension. It maintains a truly sacramental view of the material elements, thereby claiming the goodness of the created order and God’s right to use his created world in particular and spiritual ways, but without embracing an &lt;em&gt;ex opere operato&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of his grace along the way. Finally, it both maintains the actual presence of Christ himself and is beautifully Trinitarian, understanding that presence as effected by the Spirit, who both catches the believer up to heaven and mediates the Savior to his people in their fellowship, as believers partake of the free gift of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper is a demonstration of the unity of Christ’s people, and as such it should be extended as widely as possible. On the one hand, it is important to offer the Supper only to those who are professing believers in Christ. On the other, refusing communion to those who worship the Trinitarian God in the risen Lord Jesus proclaims division in the very practice meant to display the church’s unity. Against the practice of “closed” communion, churches should welcome to the table any who trust in Christ. “It is a meal of remembrance for Jesus’ sacrifice that brought us forgiveness from sins. As such it is solely a meal for disciples…. Therefore our communion is open to all who profess to be followers and disciples of Christ.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to frequency, Scripture is silent, and so it behooves Christians today not to press any position too strongly. Yet it still seems fair to say that if indeed the ordinance is a place of special meeting between Christ and his people, then his people should be eager to meet with him often. In that light, weekly communion seems best. However, this does not necessarily entail partaking of the Table in every service (though it may). Churches might also opt to leave it at its current monthly or quarterly frequency for corporate gatherings, but make it a part of the weekly gathering of small groups, for example, thus emphasizing both the broader community of the church and the particular unity of the communities within it.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many believers are tempted to dismiss these sorts of details as of little importance—secondary issues that do not or should not affect them or the life of their church. However, because the church’s practice of the Lord’s Supper has implications in so much of the church’s life, her doctrine and practice at the Table are in fact quite important. Rightly understood and practiced, the Table teaches the church about Christology, the communion of the saints, the work of the Spirit, the goodness of the created order, and the relationship between Christ’s work and God’s grace. These are not light matters; they are foundational in the life of the church. The high-church traditions certainly have this much right, then: the liturgies and practices of the church matter. Indeed, in many ways, the &lt;em&gt;practices&lt;/em&gt; of a community may be as profound a force in shaping her people as the &lt;em&gt;proclamations&lt;/em&gt; of her leaders.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any Christian community with deficient views or practices of communion will &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; be lacking in its worship and fellowship. Christians are called to unity, and it is around the table that their unity is most deeply proclaimed. If there is any place for ecumenism among Christian denominations, it is at the Table. Likewise, Christians are called to worship not just Christ-the-idea, but Christ-the-man, whose body and blood they spiritually receive for the nourishment of their souls: the good gift of the Father, worked in them by the Spirit. Christ the Lord is seated in heaven, and is spiritually present everywhere, but he is spiritually present &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; at the Table,&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and this is a great comfort to saints in the midst of trials and woes.&lt;/p&gt;

Barber and Robert A. Peterson’s &lt;em&gt;Life Everlasting&lt;/em&gt; is an introductory look at the Biblical picture of heaven and eschatological hope. The authors, noting the prevalence of near-death experience accounts, the fascination many Christians evince with life after death, and the many misunderstandings about heaven and Christian hope that are prevalent among both Christians and non-Christians, aim to reset the focus of the discussion on what the Bible has to say about these matters. After a brief introduction, they examine in turn the ideas of Creation, Rest, Kingdom, Presence, and Glory through the lens of a Creation-Fall-Redemption-Restoration reading of Scripture. For each major idea they survey, they supply a chapter examining how how things are meant to be (Creation), how they have been distorted (Fall), how Christ’s work ushers in renewal (Redemption), and how believers may expect and hope them to turn out in the end (Restoration). In each pair of chapters, they spend the bulk of their time surveying (albeit very briefly) some of the biblical material on the topic under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barber and Peterson open with a section on Creation in order to argue that central and essential to Christian hope—and too often overlooked or misunderstood—is the idea of physical resurrection. In their opening section, they trace out this idea effectively and substantively. However, though they continue to give nods to the idea of the resurrection’s importance through the remainder of the book, they largely fall prey to one of the traps they decry in their intro: they focus almost entirely on &lt;em&gt;spiritual&lt;/em&gt; realities to the exclusion of &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; realities. As a result their analysis of the ideas of rest, kingdom, and presence are all substantially impoverished in various ways, and even their (better) treatment of Glory leaves a bit to be desired. It is not that what they say is incorrect; they present the Biblical picture of those spiritual elements of future hope well and fairly compellingly (albeit a bit blandly). Rather, it is that in each case, they simply fail to address key and essential repercussions of the embodied nature of Christian hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their discussion of rest, the authors repeatedly emphasize their view that the Christian’s hope of rest is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in fact physical, but rather is simply a matter of experiencing fellowship with God. They note that Christians will rest from their labors, and give a token nod to the idea that they may continuing doing something or other in the new heavens and new earth, but spend no time whatsoever considering how that informs believers’ view of vocation in the present. Though they acknowledge that labor in the Garden was good, they say little about the continuing goodness of work, and skip almost entirely over the prospect of the restoration of work to a human &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; in the coming age. Besides failing to account for the full biblical narrative, this has significant pastoral consequences. The fallen world alternately presents believers with the two dangers of resenting all work or of idolizing it. The answer to these solutions is not to look to a merely spiritual hope of rest, but rather to recognize that the shape of work must be understood in light of its creation and its promised eschatological renewal. Christians today are members of an outpost of the eschatological age in the here and now; believers are citizens of the future age, attempting to live out the realities of the age to come even as the world around remains broken and unrestored. Christians’ approach to their work, then, should reflect the inherent goodness of generative activity, the hope that their labors will produce real reward in the age to come, and a God-honoring delight in the goodness of that work. Barber and Peterson neatly lay the groundwork for this, but fail to do anything with that groundwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They similarly focus entirely on spiritualized visions of &lt;em&gt;kingdom&lt;/em&gt;. While they acknowledge that the kingdom will be in the new heavens and new earth, they spend no time whatsoever on the implications of this for justice, reconciliation, or the healing of the nations—despite the fact that these are all clearly taught, and at great length, in the pages of Scripture. The consummation of God’s reign in his human agents (and specifically Jesus Christ) does have enormous spiritual implications, and Barber and Peterson’s point that Satan and his forces will be defeated and the kingdom at peace at last is well-taken. However, the Biblical pictures of the kingdom include far more than the end of deception and death; it entails the kingdoms of the world having become the kingdom of Christ, and the nations living in harmony with each other. It includes ethnic reconciliation, peace and harmony throughout the earth, the end of economic oppression, and true justice for everyone. These are not merely the concerns of this generation; they are themes that run throughout the pages of the Bible, from Jeremianic condemnations of Israelite failure to practice justice to Paul’s rebuke of ethnic divisions in the early church. No picture of the coming kingdom that misses these elements is either Biblically faithful or pastorally appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt;, Barber and Peterson once again do good preparatory work but then fail to capitalize on it. Their discussion of how God’s people originally experienced his presence nicely captures the reality that God would come and walk in the Garden of Eden: he was in some mysterious way physically present with them. However, as in the other sections, Barber and Peterson turn primarily to spiritual concerns after their introduction, and their discussion of restoration never even mentions on the reality of Christ’s everlasting incarnation. Still less does it derive from that one of the great hopes of the Christian life: that believers will &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; God. Christians will be able to converse with the incarnate Son, and his humanity will forever be paradigmatic for all other resurrected saints. The resurrected Messiah figures centrally in the New Testament and especially John’s vision; it is astounding that he should be set aside for a spiritualizing discussion that minimizes the physical reality of the new Jerusalem (even if that discussion is largely accurate in its description of the intent of the “new Jerusalem” sequence in Revelation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gladly, the authors’ treatment of &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt; does a little better, as they devote some time to the goodness and attributes of the resurrected body. Unsurprisingly, though, given the trajectory of the rest of the book, that discussion is soon set aside for a discussion about the nature of heavenly rewards (one that ultimately concludes that there are no tangible heavenly rewards whatsoever!). This seems a fitting summary of the book’s weaknesses in this area: when the authors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; address the resurrection directly, it is largely on target—but they too rarely address the resurrection; even more rarely do they trace out its implications for future hope, and still less its impact on life in the time between the times. This failure to consider or apply the promise of physical resurrection and cosmic restoration in areas that are both Biblically significant and pastorally urgent makes the book much less valuable than it might otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;

Hellerman argues that the health of the church depends on embracing what he describes as a strong-group culture mentality. Based on insights from sociology, he maintains that the “family” language of Scripture, and especially that of the New Testament, should lead believers to embrace the same kind of cultural norms that characterized families in the ancient Mediterranean world where the Bible was written. He first explains how that strong-group culture works, contrasting it with the individualistic (or “weak-group”) culture of the west: individual desires are sublimated to those of the group, and decisions are made both within the context of the group and with the good of the group foremost. He then defends the idea that this was how the New Testament church community was structured, before turning to a general discussion of how the practice of the Western church might need to change to accommodate this kind of cultural shift. In this practical turn, Hellerman considers a number of cases studies for how this has played out in his experience, as well as the implications for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hellerman’s argument has much to recommend it on the whole, his treatment of the Bible’s relationship to strong- and weak-group cultures leaves a great deal to be desired. Granted that the Bible clearly rejects the kind of radical individualism that characterizes contemporary evangelicalism, and granted further that Hellerman rightly emphasizes the communal and familial language of the New Testament in particular, nonetheless he substantially overstates the case for “strong-group” communities, and in doing so partly undermines an otherwise strong and helpful book. Hellerman repeatedly argues that the Bible clearly and unabashedly appropriates and affirms the strong-group culture of the surrounding world. This is the thesis with which he opens the book, and he dedicates the first half of the book to defending it from the pages of Scripture and the early years of church history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Hellerman’s thesis cannot be sustained—at least, not as he presents it. Scripture does appropriate at times from the strong-group ideas of the surrounding culture at times, but it never does so unreservedly, and it often corrects those ideas. First, while Hellerman argues repeatedly and at great length that the dominant understanding of group identity and especially family from the surrounding culture presented patrilineal family groups as primary, and sibling identity as trumping all others, including those from marriage, God rejects that approach to the family itself from the earliest pages of Scripture. Very much &lt;em&gt;unlike&lt;/em&gt; the culture Hellerman praises, with its prioritizing of blood families over a spouse, Genesis clarifies that the pattern for God’s people is that the new relationship formed in marriage takes first place (Gen. 2:24; cf. Eph. 5:31). Likewise, many of the very passages that Hellerman cites as evidence for the strength of the new community Jesus formed among his followers—and especially the most challenging passages where Jesus speaks of hating father and mother and siblings for his sake—implicitly undermine the surrounding culture’s understanding of community and systems. Hellerman rightly sees that these passages emphasized the commitment the new Christ-followers were to have to the eschatological community; he misses the inherent critique of the existing structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pattern plays out in Hellerman’s readings of Acts, the Epistles, and early church history. Regarding Acts, for example, he asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radical discipline Ananias and Sapphira experienced at the hand of God demonstrates that the collectivist ‘group comes first’ conviction constitutes a central principle for New Testament social ethics. To lie about this aspect of discipleship is to undermine the very foundation for the community God is building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, as the passage itself makes clear, their sin was &lt;em&gt;lying to the Holy Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. The issue of communal responsibility was irrelevant—except, perhaps, insofar as it provoked them to act in a way that would garner group approval. In his treatment of the Epistles, Hellerman asserts but does not demonstrate that the writers approved of their culture’s view of family. Yes, the early Christians called each other brother and sister; no, they did not necessarily therefore affirm everything their culture meant in that. That the church constitutes a family is clear; that that family should behave in line with the honor-driven, insular fashion of the New Testament world is not. Ancient Mediterranean families would cut off those who stumbled and shamed them; the church gave succor to just those people. Similarly, he takes the consistent testimony to Christian love in the history of the early church as evidence for his theme. In fact, many of the examples he cites serve to demonstrate just how broken the surrounding strong-group cultures were, and how the church thrived by forging a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; way. In all of this, Hellerman repeatedly fails to acknowledge how thoroughly the work of God has been a work of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the group and the individual. Both Old or New Testament resound with stories of personal success and failure side by side with those of God’s people. The Biblical picture is &lt;em&gt;both-and&lt;/em&gt;: individuals mutually serving each other and giving themselves up for each other, but not in the process losing their individuality or the unique insight and vision God has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is clear that Hellerman’s thesis drives his exegesis—he never even considers evidence that might right contrary to his thesis. This is too bad. Hellerman’s claim that the Western church needs a healthy dose of strong-group thinking does not stand or fall with the idea that strong-group culture is God’s preferred culture. Indeed, his argument would have been much stronger had he acknowledged the ways that God’s new culture takes the best of strong-group culture (as it does the best of weak-group culture!) and forms it into something new and better. Indeed, the Western church &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need to retreat from its comfort in highly individualistic, weak-group cultures. American evangelicals have a great deal to learn from strong-group cultures—whether those in the pages of the New Testament, or those of many Majority World cultures. Recovery of the kinds of values Hellerman outlines, and their practical application, will indeed be necessary for thriving and healthy churches. But Hellerman’s approach fails to take seriously the ways in which &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; human cultures are broken, strong- and weak-group alike. Hellerman knows the weaknesses of weak-group cultures quite well; whether he has ever seen the failings of strong-group cultures up close seems doubtful given his lavish praise of those cultures and how little good he has to say of weak-group cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay will demonstrate that the concluding section of Lamentations 3, running from v. 40 to v. 66, constitutes an open-ended, multivocal answer to the question posed in Lamentations 3:39: “Why should a person complain, / a living man concerning his sins?” The poet did not believe Yahweh demanded silence of his people, even in the face of his judgment. Rather, his people were to trust him deeply enough to call out to him, even when all evidence suggested he would not answer. The point will be demonstrated by a close analysis of the structure, verbs, and poetic devices employed throughout the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="authorship" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authorship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations has traditionally been attributed to Jeremiah, but the poems themselves make no claim to authorship whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jeremianic authorship is possible, and a few commentators continue to argue for it as a reasonable assumption.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, while there are commonalities in style and vocabulary between the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and no outright contradictions between the two books,&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are also significant differences between them. Jeremiah predicted the destruction of the city and the temple while the author of Lamentations seems surprised by it, and Jeremiah strongly emphasizes the sins of the people while the author of Lamentations hardly mentions them.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These differences in perspective might be the result of the prophet’s experience of the fall of Jerusalem as opposed to merely the anticipation thereof, but more likely whoever composed the book “was familiar with the book of Jeremiah, but had his own vocabulary to express grief over the fall of Jerusalem.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators argue not only against Jeremianic authorship but for multiple authorship.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Such a reading is hardly required, however. The suggestion that variation in perspective or even poetic style can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be explained by multiple authorship badly underestimates the range of human artistry.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Poetic voice is not the same as &lt;em&gt;authorial&lt;/em&gt; voice;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the multiple voices which appear throughout the book are “poetic vehicles through which the poet speaks throughout”&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than multiple authors arguing for differing theologies. Even if Lamentations is the product of multiple poets, the poems ultimately represent continuity of thought and theology, both individually and collectively.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Together, they present a multivocal but coherent expression of grief in the face of horrific tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="geographical-and-cultural" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geographical and Cultural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations was composed in response to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and its temple and the deportation of Judean leadership in 595–587 B.C. However, it is not clear how long after the fall of Jerusalem the poems were composed, nor whether they were composed simultaneously or with some gaps between them. The book was probably composed prior to the rebuilding of the temple in 515 B.C., since the text includes no hint of such a hopeful turn of events,&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the author’s imaginative and lyrical skill count for more than his proximity to the events he describes.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In any case, the date of composition is largely irrelevant to the interpretation of the text.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the Hebrew Bible, Lamentations adopts from but freely adapts genres from the surrounding cultures. Accordingly, it includes elements of Ancient Near East city laments, communal laments, and communal dirges.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Records of city laments in the greater Mesopotamian region date to the beginning of the second millennium B.C., and the author of Lamentations joined various prophetic writers in the Old Testament in repurposing the form for his theological purposes.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whereas most city-laments appear to have been created for rededications of temples and thus include the imagery of a god’s return to the temple, Yahweh is conspicuously absent and his temple in ruins throughout Lamentations.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the theology of Lamentations differs significantly from the city-laments. Though the poet gives full voice to doubt and anger towards Yahweh throughout the book, he ultimately places moral responsibility not on Yahweh but on the sinning people of Jerusalem, very much unlike the anti-theodic bent of other city laments.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The text mingles “penitence &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; protest, confession &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; lament.”&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="literary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Literary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book consists of five poems, each sharing the same basic acrostic structure. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have twenty-two multi-line verses, each beginning with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chapter 3 changes the pattern, devoting three single-line verses to each letter. Finally, chapter 5 consists of another twenty-two verses of poetry, but does not include the acrostic lettering scheme. The acrostics draw the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and express a sense of completion at their conclusion: grief has been fully sounded and emotional and theological catharsis experienced.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet &lt;em&gt;imposes&lt;/em&gt; order on a world in chaos by choosing to “express the inexpressible… [in poems] whose controlling structural device is the very letters that signify and give shape to language.”&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the repetition of letters, as of words and ideas throughout the poem, “introduces the indispensable element of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;: reflection and re-reflection on the meaning of the aesthetic message.”&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, the frequent use of enjambment both works with the acrostic to propel the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and undermines the poetry’s regularity, allowing the poet to control the pace of the poem “without relying on emplottment [sic] or even strong characterization.”&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These large-scale poetic devices together shape not only the structure but also the message of the poetry: lines give different senses when read alone than when read in their acrostic strophe, and different again when read in the full sequence.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They ultimately “draw the reader into a variety of responses… [not] one particular response.”&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3 is the theological and poetic center of the book.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although some modern commentators hesitate to affirm the centrality of the chapter because of a tendency to downplay the lament elsewhere in the book,&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are good reasons to take this view. Structurally, the center is often important to Hebrew poetry, and while that importance can be overstated, the placement of the poem here should not be ignored—especially when its poetry and content differ from the others in such a notable way.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The increased repetition heightens the effect and draws attention to the content of the poetry.&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The shorter lines are visually and aurally arresting. The chapter includes theodic content and, at times, a hopeful tone—kinds of content absent in the rest of the poems. It is also the only poem in which words are attributed to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The literary and theological emphasis the poet placed on this chapter is not a reason to ignore the message of the other chapters, but neither should it be ignored in interpreting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter has three major sections, though commentators divide them in slightly different ways; the exegesis below analysis assumes the following division. In the first section (vv. 1–18), “the man who has seen affliction” (3:1) laments his individual suffering at God’s hands. The second section (vv. 19–39) emphasizes Yahweh’s covenant love, trustworthy character, and hatred of injustice; it is the most hopeful and theodic passage in the book. In the third section (vv. 40–66), the speaker responds to the theodic ideas outlined in the second with a complex mix of complaint, lament, hope, and imprecation. This concluding turn has led some commentators to suggest the speaker ultimately could not believe the ethical/theodic message,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or that he was angrily determined to “speak in the face of Yahweh’s silence;”&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it has led others to suggest competing authors (see above). But “[the] speaker is not schizophrenic.”&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The same person may simultaneously recognize his own sinful responsibility, trust God, and yet remain long for deliverance from and be troubled by his suffering.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Though all of these themes appear scattered throughout the book, Lamentations 3 alone draws them together in a single poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section begins in v. 40. Although there are later topical and vocal shifts (especially in v. 42; see below), none are as strong as the one leading the נ-strophe, which is doubly marked. The speaker shifts from general statements about Yahweh to exhortation of the listening community precisely at the transition from the מ-strophe to the נ-strophe. Indeed, given the enjambment across strophe boundaries typical of the final section of the poem,&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the alignment here clearly indicates a major transition in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="we-repent-but-god-has-not-forgiven-us-4051" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Repent but God Has Not Forgiven Us (40–51)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker has finished his discourse on who Yahweh is and how he acts; now it is time to respond. In light of the preceding declaration of Yahweh’s covenant love and justice, and its “emphasis on confession and penitence”&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker urges his people to turn and repent. He turns almost immediately to a lengthy lament, however: God has not forgiven. Indeed, the divine warrior has struck down his own people.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Things seems hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="let-us-repent-4042a" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let us repent! (40–42a)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yahweh’s covenant love may be trusted and he judges rightly, and if his people have sinned, they ought to repent. The speaker employs the language of (especially Jeremianic) prophetic exhortation, calling the people to search out and examine their ways and return to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Unlike in Jeremiah, though, the speaker includes himself in the call to repentance. The opening verbs of the section are not imperatives but cohortatives (נַחְפְּשָׂ֤ה, נַחְקֹ֔רָה, נָשׁ֖וּבָה). The speaker thus affirms that his and his people’s sin has led to their current condition; they must repent. The imperfect that follows (נִשָּׂ֤א) picks up the force of the preceding cohortatives and continues the exhortation. The language of “hearts with hands” reminds the reader that the repentance required is an act of the whole person: neither merely internal nor merely external.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The reference to “God in heaven” does double duty: it marks his authority to forgive, but it also suggests his absence from Zion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="god-is-still-hidden-42b44" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God is still hidden (42b–44)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following verses, the author begins by confessing sin, then addresses Yahweh, who has not forgiven his people, and who has instead opposed them and hidden himself from their prayers. Israel’s divine warrior-God has now become her enemy.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The God whose presence with his people was so often manifest as a cloud&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now removed his presence from them with a cloud.&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The people may confess, but unless Yahweh hears their prayers and answers them, they will remain destitute and hopeless.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In light of the speaker’s confession and the hope expressed in the preceding major section, that Yahweh has not forgiven comes as a surprise, and one intensified dramatically by the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the poetry here is enjambed twice, making it one of the more prominent of the many instances of the poetic device throughout this section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, the poet introduces the address to Yahweh at the end of the נ-strophe instead of at beginning of the ס-strophe. Second, the poet splits the line itself. The first verset continues the thought of the preceding two lines: the people’s repentance before God, in the form of confession: “we have transgressed and rebelled.” The second verset indicates God’s response: “—you have not forgiven!” There is no transition, not even a disjunctive-ו to mark the shift—just a terse pair of statements. Indeed, the effect is so jarring, especially as it leads into the next strophe, that it is tempting to read the entire rest of the poem as accusation against and anger against God.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Understandable as this reading is—especially as a backlash against the inappropriate suppression of lament among Christians—it is mistaken, as will become clear.&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; complain here and in what follows, but that is not all he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tonal shift between v. 42a and v. 42b, it is possible to read this as the break between the second and third major sections of the book. As noted above, the major discourse boundary is between vv. 39 and 40 instead, where the speaker transitions from exposition to response. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a segue here, as the speaker turns his attention from his community to Yahweh, and begins a speech section that runs through v. 47, but this transition is within rather than between sections—from one kind of response to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="we-are-devastated-by-our-enemies-4547" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We are devastated by our enemies (45–47)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the poet employs enjambment to drive the reader into the speaker’s experience of suffering. The transition between the ס- and פ-strophes occurs in v. 46, but already in v. 45 the speaker returns to a theme expressed in the beginning of the chapter as well as in the preceding poems: enemies attacking the people of God. Not only is Yahweh absent from Zion, but he has made her like refuse and waste&lt;a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of the peoples. The tribes he had chosen to be a blessing to the nations (Gen. 12:3; 18:17–19) and set apart as a kingdom of priests (Exod. 19:6; Deut. 17:18) were defilement—things to be thrown out of the camp (cf. Exod. 29:14). Moreover, rather than delivering from enemies, God has brought them against his people.&lt;a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They have “opened their mouths” against God’s people, an image used in the Wisdom literature both of speaking against someone and of devouring them (Job 29:23; Ps. 5:9; 22:13; 35:21). The climax of the quotation comes in verse 47, a chiasm on two pairs of words which rhyme almost completely.&lt;a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “Dread and death, devastation and ruination”—this is what Yahweh has accomplished in bringing these enemies against his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment may not have been unexpected—everything that happened to Jerusalem was expressly the result of a covenant curse—but the circumstances were no less horrific for that. That the judgment was deserved did not lessen the urgency of the speaker’s cry for relief.&lt;a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker’s complaint raises the poem’s tension by pitting this lament against the theodic material which precedes it.&lt;a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker may not be shaking his fist at the heavens, but he is certainly complaining loudly and questioning insistently. If Yahweh is loving, faithful, and just, is this judgment not too harsh? At this point, the ethical vision expressed in vv. 19–39 seems lost. Indeed, Miriam Bier and F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp both suggest that the poet &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to embrace the ethical vision, but that this and the section following demonstrate his inability to do so.&lt;a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Were this the final note of the poem, this analysis would be basically correct. It is not, but things get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="sight-and-salvation-4851" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sight and salvation (48–51)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker echoes the end of v. 47 at the end of v. 48, tying the two together, but shifts in person (from “we” to “I”).&lt;a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The identity of the speaker shifts slightly as a result: he spoke first for himself alone, then exhorted his community, and now stands in solidarity with the community of Zion.&lt;a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet connects these verses, from the last line of the פ-strophe through the whole ע-strophe, with the idea of eyes and sight. The poet’s eyes pour out channels of water and flow without ceasing or respite, until Yahweh looks and sees. The poet and his people desperately need Yahweh’s deliverance—and Yahweh remains enthroned in heaven. The poet carefully reiterates the idea suggested in the נ-strophe, delaying the subject of v. 50 to the second half of the line to match the structure of v. 41. The inclusio emphasizes both Yahweh’s sovereignty and his distance from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Yahweh sees—until he stops shrouding himself from his people’s prayers and hears their cries as he did in Exodus 1—the poet’s eyes continue to torment him because of the sad state of the women of the city (v. 51). The final line is curiously expressive: the speaker’s eyes are harsh to his soul—a phrase that has been taken to mean that his eyes literally ache from his crying and that the things he sees torment him.&lt;a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, the terse language suggests both: in the immediate context, the speaker’s weeping wears him out; more broadly, soul-distressing suffering is nearly omnipresent in these poems. Although he clearly hopes for change, he is no longer addressing Yahweh as of v. 48. He simply states how things are and will remain until God acts: these horrors demand grief. And perhaps Yahweh will hear these tears, even if he seems to have heard nothing else (though nothing in the context or language here suggests these tears are meant to &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt; God into responding).&lt;a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The section closes without any such response, though; all hope seems lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="deliver-me-from-my-enemies-5266" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deliver me from my enemies! (52–66)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concluding section is like an individual psalm of lament.&lt;a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It continues the shift begun in v. 19. The chapter (as well as the book) opens with the image of God as a divine warrior fighting against his people, but it concludes with a plea for God to act in line with his character.&lt;a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker hopes that Yahweh will restore his people to covenant unity with him and defend them from their enemies, but refuses to collapse the tension between hope and lament that characterizes the whole poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-verb-tense-and-meaning-in-poetry" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Verb Tense and Meaning in Poetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb tense throughout the final section of the poem is a subject of much debate. Commentators differ especially on how to take the mix of perfects and imperfects in vv. 56–58, but significant differences appear beginning as early as v. 52. Some take the verbs to be a mix of past statement and present need or imperative,&lt;a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but this does not account for the ongoing nature of the speaker’s distress (as indicated by the imperatives in the following section).&lt;a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others read both the perfects and imperfects as a series of present-tense declarations of faith.&lt;a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This view rightly captures the sense of present distress, but does not account for the perfect-imperfect alternation and has no basis for distinguishing between these “present-tense” perfects and the ordinary past-tense perfects that precede them. Thus, some suggest that the perfects carry a precative sense, with the imperfects then naturally reading as more imperatives.&lt;a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In addition to being an unusual and debated syntactical stance, however, this also fails to answer why the poet did not use simple imperatives (as in vv. 59, 63). Even if these verbs simply represent the poet shifting to the perfect-imperfect alternation common to poetry,&lt;a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is the only place in the entire final section of the poem where the pattern appears. At the least, it marks the sequence by distinction with the surrounding verses. Thus, none of the proposals satisfactorily account for all the features of the text, though perfect-as-precative is not unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that this ambiguity is a function only of modern scholars’ relative ignorance of the language—that native speakers readily took in the meaning of the poetry when Lamentations was written. It is equally plausible, however, that the poet &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; the meaning to remain elusive. This is one of the functions of poetry: to push the boundaries of what language can express and thereby convey feeling and sense beyond the merely literal. The poet in Lamentations employs a wide array of tools to this end in this final section of the poem, including structure (the acrostic), enjambment, rhythm, rhyme and assonance, ellipsis, and allusion. Perhaps the poet wanted audience to wonder: has Yahweh delivered already, spoken already, judged the enemies already—or is the speaker still waiting for Yahweh to hear his prayers? In the world of faith, the answer may be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;: the believer may be fully confident that Yahweh’s answer is assured, and still feel no less keenly the fact that experience does not yet bear out that answer. The text is open; it not only allows for but actively invites both readings.&lt;a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “[Both] past and future signify the ongoing present. The suffering in Lamentations is timeless, and the expression of timelessness seems to have been one of the poet’s goals.”&lt;a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-enemies-despair-and-pleading-5255" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My enemies! Despair and pleading (52–55)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The צ-strophe opens with a stereotyped image of the beleaguered servant of God: the person hunted like a bird (cf. Prov. 6:5; Pss. 11:1, 124:7, 140:5) by those who hated him for no reason (cf. 1 Sam. 19:15, 25:31; Ps. 35:7, 69:5). The strophe continues with a description of the enemies’ depredations. The circuitous language (literally, they put an end to his life, with the action occurring in a pit) conveys the idea of people seeking to end his life by throwing him into a pit and hurling stones at him (cf. Pss. 18:41, 73:27, 94:23).&lt;a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The image is not a dry pit like the ones Joseph and Jeremiah were thrown into (Gen. 38:24; Jer. 38:6). Instead, water went up over the speaker’s head (cf. Ps: 69:1–2). Besides being yet more stock lament imagery,&lt;a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the water language connects this sequence back to the preceding one, even as the focus has changed. So likewise with the “pit” language, whose implied metaphorical use as a substitute for death or the grave&lt;a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is heightened by proximity to v. 47, where it is used precisely that way. The poetry is also enjambed again much as it was at the end of the נ-strophe. The first half of the line in v. 54 continues the complaint theme of the preceding verses, but the latter half begins a recitation of speech to and interaction with Yahweh. The poet carries this theme further as he begins the ק-strophe (v. 55) with the speaker’s having cried out Yahweh’s name from the “deepest pit,” a phrase suggestive of Sheol.&lt;a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these verses is particularly striking or unusual next to other laments in the Old Testament, and this is in its own way significant. The speaker has made a small but meaningful change in his language and tone: Yahweh is no longer the enemy but instead the one who might deliver &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the enemies.&lt;a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to traditional, even stereotyped, language of lament and petition signals the speaker’s self-conscious identification with Israel’s history of trusting Yahweh for deliverance. This does not mark the resolution of the trial, but it does undercut the idea that the end of the poem is unrelentingly pessimistic—especially when coupled with the verses that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="yahweh-hearsmay-yahweh-hear-5658" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yahweh hears/May Yahweh hear (56–58)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sequence (continuing the ק-strophe and running into the first line of the ר-strophe) is a striking sequence and is key to understanding the poet’s intent in the final section of the poem. The speaker proclaims Yahweh’s response to his call for help from the edge of death. Per the discussion above, this section is best read as holding together the tensions of past-and-future, actual-and-desired: “you heard my voice” and “hear my voice” (v. 56); “you came on the day I called” and “come on the day I call,” “you said to me” and “say to me” (v. 57); “you strove for my life” and “strive for my life” (v. 58). This is the climax of the final section, the place where the poet’s pleas climax and, more significantly, the only place in the entire book where Yahweh speaks. The words the poet attributes to Yahweh are simple—אַל־תִּירָֽא, “do not fear”—but pack depths into their brief syllables. For the canonically attentive reader, these words immediately call to mind all the places Yahweh tells his people not to fear, and where he inevitably promised his presence and his aid to his people against their enemies.&lt;a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet the poet elides the second part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to take the poet’s intended sense without paying attention to “the way in which the sequence as a whole coheres and interacts, and even to how the poet articulates theological interests.”&lt;a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This allusion grounds the final segment of the poem in a measure of hope. At the same time, by leaving the promise of Yahweh’s presence merely an allusion, rather than stating it straight out, the poet carefully sustains the tension between &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;not-yet&lt;/em&gt; that drives the conclusion of the poem. Turn the phrases one way, and the speaker is pleading for God to comfort his people by making his presence known; turn them the other and the speaker is proclaiming that this is precisely what God has already done. Both perspectives affirm the community’s need for deliverance and for Yahweh’s presence to return; but the poetry hangs between the two, unresolved. The poet has left both readings possible, perhaps even necessary. Complaint remains,&lt;a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yet Israel’s hope that Yahweh was and would be with them remains, too.&lt;a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="may-yahweh-judge-the-enemies-5966" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May Yahweh judge the enemies (59–66)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem concludes with the resumption of the speaker’s complaint about the enemies, followed by an imprecatory prayer against them; both the complaint and the imprecation echo the imprecatory psalms.&lt;a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The only two imperatives proper in vv. 40–66 appear here: the speaker pleads with God to judge his case (v. 59) and to observe his enemies’ actions (v. 63). In the complaint, which takes up the final line of the ר-strophe and the entire ש-strophe, he lists out his enemies’ offenses. They sought (unwarranted) vengeance on, connived against, reproached, rose up against, slandered, plotted against, and made a mockery of him (cf. 14:16–17, 23:7).&lt;a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The lines are terse and elliptical, with verbs few and far between; the result reads like a list of charges in a court case, crying out for a verdict.&lt;a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imprecatory prayer comprises the ת-strophe, where a series of imperfects take up an imperatival force. The only unusual item in the list is the phrase translated “obstinate hearts,” מְגִנַּת, a hapax which appears only here and may be derived from מָגֵן, “shield.” Literally, the speaker asks for Yahweh to give them something like “covering-of-heart”—the idea seems to be hard-heartedness (thus “obstinate”)—so that the enemies will receive the judgment they are due (cf. Exo. 7:3,13).&lt;a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These imprecations are not merely selfish requests for personal vengeance. Rather, they are a plea for Yahweh to execute divine justice, in line with his character as speaker described it in the middle section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not that the poet thinks that his proclamation of faith resolved everything. Instead, echoing both the Psalms and Jeremiah,&lt;a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;83&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker implores Yahweh for deliverance, confident that God &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help but desperately needing that ability to become action.&lt;a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem ends on an unresolved note, unlike most of the psalms of imprecation or lament (notable exceptions including Pss. 44, 60).&lt;a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But this is appropriate to the poet’s aims. He presents not a cheery resolve to act as though everything is better in light of the ethical and theodic vision presented in vv. 19–39, but rather an attempt to apply that vision when circumstances remain unchanged.&lt;a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The result is closure, but not resolution. The acrostic is complete, and the speaker’s grief has been expiated to a degree—but until things are right again, pleading and lament remain. Yahweh may be good and his judgments righteous, but that does not require his people’s silence when he punishes them. To the contrary, it allows them to express their grief and anger in the hope of a merciful and gracious response from their covenant God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading makes sense of the shape of the poem as a whole. Because of the brighter notes sounded in vv. 19–39, a few commentators take this poem as ending positively.&lt;a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others take the final 26 verses as a negative response to the (apparently) rhetorical questions posed in vv. 36–39.&lt;a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Neither of these readings does justice to the tension of the poetry. Instead, the poet has played the enjambment card again, at a yet larger level. The final (originally rhetorical) question of the middle section actually received an answer: Why should a man complain about the punishment of his sins? Because even when the judgment was deserved, Yahweh may yet answer, silence the enemy, and draw near to his people. In one sense, he already has; in another, his people are still waiting—and the poet leaves it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, scholars have applied Lamentations to everything from Freudian grief models&lt;a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to massive national tragedies.&lt;a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Freudian model of grief has some serious deficiencies—but applications of Lamentations 3 in that context do help people both to articulate their grief and to respond to loss.&lt;a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Application to national tragedies is even more appropriate. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen horrific loss of life; even in largely untouched America, community has disintegrated over the same period. Thus, “the unrelenting relevance of this poetry cries out to be heard and understood.”&lt;a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reading Lamentations more frequently and deeply will help Western Christians understand the trials of fellow believers enduring persecution for the name of Christ. It will also provide a framework for sympathizing with peoples around the world facing ethnic cleansing or other such horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities are painful, but they are realities nonetheless. With some of the Psalms, Lamentations addresses human suffering head-on as few other places in Scripture do, pointing the way to a deep, rich, honest, and trusting response to tragedy. The concluding section of chapter 3 is particularly helpful: God sometimes delays his deliverance; repentance does not always lead immediately to restoration; and the enemies of God’s people go on harassing them far longer than seems right. In those moments, people and their pastors have a model to follow: crying out to God as long as his answer remains &lt;em&gt;already-but-not-yet&lt;/em&gt;. Believers ought to spend time reading, meditating on, and praying through these words. Pastors should acquaint themselves with the book deeply so they can minister to their congregants facing trials, and they should preach on it more often to equip their congregations for those trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3:40–66 represents an invitation to cry out to God even in the midst of judgment—to believe that he may yet hear. In their hesitation to voice this kind of lament at in the face of life’s travails, many Christians reveal that they do not know their God as well as they ought. “The suffering is, as it were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel’s God.”&lt;a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If even God’s judgment on Israel was a painful picture of his faithfulness, how much more when he has shared our griefs, borne our sufferings in his own flesh, and been judged to the point of crying out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And so he remains open to his people’s cries—for, until suffering ends, lament remains.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>papers</category></item><item><title>An Uncomfortable Fit</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/an-uncomfortable-fit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a small, non-denominational, baptistic, charismatic church. Speaking in tongues, the use of private prayer languages, claims to words of knowledge and prophecies, and the expectation of miraculous healings were common. Unfortunately, even granting a continuationist view of the gifts, the church’s practice was never in line with New Testament guidelines for the gifts—no translation of tongues, for example, or requirement that prophecy be fulfilled for the prophet to be judged true. I grew disillusioned with the charismatic approach to the gifts by late high school, and spent several of the following years as a near-cessationist. I remain skeptical of most charismatic churches’ practice of the gifts, but am not a cessationist: I see no compelling exegetical argument for the position. I am especially open to the likelihood of the miraculous gifts in frontier missions context, where they serve to validate the proclamation of the gospel over and above demonic powers worshipped in polytheistic, animistic, and shamanistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, I spent two years attending a fairly traditional Southern Baptist church. For the latter half of my time in college and the three years following, I was a member of a non-demoninational, baptistic, broadly evangelical church with my wife Jaimie. During that time, I remained baptistic, but began to become concerned with the lack of confessional moorings in most baptistic churches (denominational or non-denominational alike). Along the way, I shifted from the non-Calvinistic views held by most charismatics and Baptists to an Edwardsian Calvinism and developed stronger convictions about church polity. Finally, since moving to North Carolina, we have been committed members at First Baptist Church of Durham—a healthy, elder-led, Calvinistic Southern Baptist church that we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even here, we find that we are not totally “at home”; it is not quite right to call even Calvinistic Southern Baptists “my tradition”. Indeed, it is perhaps most accurate to say that I have not yet &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; my tradition. What I have found instead are points to appreciate in a number of traditions, and an increasing identification (at least from the outside) with many elements of the Presbyterian tradition. A friend once described me as a “Pres-matic Bapt-erian”, and he seems to have been right. I find much to appreciate in the charismatic background from which I sprang, and much to value in the Baptist tradition where I currently live—but at the end of the day, it is only my credobaptist convictions keeping me within the Baptist world, rather than transitioning into Presbyterianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the charismatic tradition in which I grew up, I learned the value of affections oriented toward Christ. It is not enough to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the things of God; we must also love him and one another. Our faith must be true &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; experiential. John reminds us that “this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (John 17:3) and that “Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness” (1 John 2:9). Moreover, they emphasized that walking in the Holy Spirit is essential to the healthy Christian life. Though I might now characterize the Spirit’s primary work differently from the church of my childhood, I still affirm whole-heartedly that the Christian life is deeply and profoundly dependent on the Holy Spirit. Paul enjoins us, “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh…. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25). Likewise, John reports Jesus’ shocking statement that it is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for us that he left and sent the Spirit than that he should have remained with us (John 16:7ff.). The life of the Christian must be a Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered life. We can never overemphasize the work of the Spirit in our lives (though we may sometimes articulate that work inaccurately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Southern Baptist churches I have attended I have gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of evangelism and missions. Whether from the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20 or the similar notes sounded in Luke 24:45–49 and then throughout the book of Acts, it is clear that God’s people are called to evangelize wherever we go. (Closely related to the above point, however, this is not mere salesmanship. As Luke points out in Acts 1:8, the power for the church’s missionary work is the Holy Spirit, not human wisdom.) If the church forgets that her first and foremost calling is the proclamation of the gospel to all the nations, she will rapidly fall off the cart in one direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Baptist emphasis on regenerate church membership and the congregation’s responsibility for discipline are also essential ingredients to healthy, flourishing churches (and therefore for flourishing individual Christians). The countless “one another” passages of the New Testament ( e.g. John 13:34–35, Ephesians 4:25–32) emphasize mutual service as an essential mark of Christian fellowship. Moreover, the well-known church discipline passages (Matthew 18:15–20) indicate clearly that the members of a congregation are to look out for each other’s spiritual well-being. Although this care has sometimes been twisted to abuse in other churches, we are blessed to participate in a context where the passages’ emphasis on forgiveness and restoration is kept front and center. Meaningful membership and congregational care through church discipline are not universally popular, but they are among the hallmarks of our particular corner of the Southern Baptist convention. This kind of care for the saints is not only necessary: it is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my Presbyterian friends I have increasingly come to appreciate a more thoroughly confessional identity and the value of churches connected not only by sharing funds but also by polity. Acts 15 highlights that the early church resolved its most significant outstanding tension not by letting each church go its own way doctrinally, but by issuing a decision that was binding on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the churches. Granted: the presence of the apostles then means our situation is not identical. Still, the event demands attention. Even a church with the illustrious history and (apostolic!) leadership of the congregation at Antioch did not feel equipped to make serious doctrinal decisions without consulting the rest of the church. This is not to deny that there are clear marks of local congregational responsibility throughout the epistles, only that the New Testament pattern was of churches in active contact, cooperation, and doctrinal dependence with each other in a way that appears &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar to a proto-presbytery, and quite unlike the radical autonomy of Baptist churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the historic Reformed articulation of the relationship between the various spheres of life extremely compelling. Calvin and his heirs often advocated clearly and coherently for the goodness of the created order and for human activity therein. Here, vocation (including the arts) is taken not merely as a means to gospel proclamation, but as genuinely good in itself. This theme runs throughout Scripture: God commanded man to work before the Fall ( cf. Genesis 2:5,15), and though work has been corrupted and made toilsome by the Fall, it remains good. The world itself was created good (Genesis 1), and though it groans with us for redemption (Romans 8:19–23) it still proclaims the glory of God (see Psalm 19 for just one of many examples). Many evangelicals pay lip service to the goodness of creation and vocation, but few outside the high church traditions (especially Anglican, Lutheran, and Presbyterian) carry the doctrine through in their practice. This leaves me hungry for the kind of intellectual, vocational, and artistic engagement I see in those traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late modern evangelicalism more broadly I have imbibed both my essential Christian temperament—my unsettled, “post-denominational” eccesiastical identity included!—and two other essential ingredients: a sense of catholicity, and a desire to do more and better in caring for “the least of these.” Set against Jesus’ “new command” in John 13, the divisions within the church are painful realities we should strive to see undone wherever possible. Our disagreements are not trivial; we cannot simply toss them aside. We can, however, glory in our common experience of “mere Christianity” and take opportunities where possible to worship our risen Lord together. We can also work together across denominational boundaries to care for the orphans and widows (James 1:27), to confront injustice in this age. The needs of the world around us are severe and painful; the various wings of the church can and should unite to bring what tastes we can of the justice and mercy of Christ’s kingdom into the present age—in the church, and everywhere else (Micah 6:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I have found in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these movements a consistent emphasis on the centrality, authority, and sufficiency of Scripture. From my charismatic, Arminian-leaning youth minister to the pastors of the middle-America Bible church I attended during and after college to the elders of Calvinistic Baptist church we now call home, all have pointed consistently to God’s word as his ultimate self-revelation. These churches have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; lived out a commitment to the idea that God’s word is living and active (Hebrews 4:12) and profitable in every way (2 Timothy 3:16–17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the number of shifts in my past, the transition to another tradition would be relatively straightforward; apart from the issue of believer’s baptism, Presbyterianism looks quite appealing even now. Even beyond these more important convictional differences, I do not fit comfortably within the Baptistic tradition culturally. Its populism often verges on (and sometimes crosses into) anti-intellectualism. Its broadly helpful focus on evangelism and missions too often translates into a reductive approach that reduces all spheres of life to vehicles for gospel-proclamation—not recognizing that while in God’s providence they often serve as such, the myriad spheres of life are good in their own right. The Southern Baptist identification with the culture of the South is also problematic for someone culturally not a Southerner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on the nature of the church and the history of the Baptist movement in this class have largely solidified my pre-existing discomfort within the Baptist tradition and somewhat intensified the struggle to define my ecclesiastical identity. The theological commitments and cultural habits of (especially Southern) Baptists trouble me deeply. Reading &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way&lt;/em&gt; had precisely the opposite effect Norman intended: his polemical rhetoric bore the marks of profound ignorance of other traditions. Much of the reading on believers’ baptism was similarly dismissive—arguing not against the substance of other positions, but instead against caricatures thereof. Dockery’s call for renewal and consensus was more helpful, but it, too, had a sectarian bent. The denomination’s (and the broader tradition’s) deep anti-intellectualism and lasting suspicion of creeds and confessions make it unlikely that Southern Baptists will be able to claim the confessional identity or theological consensus they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an unfortunate reality that my experience of Baptists has too often been marked by denominational sectarianism, anti-intellectualism and anti-creedalism, and reductionistic and utilitarian approaches to God’s world. To be sure, there are exceptions to these trends, and I am grateful for them. But it means that, credobaptist though I am, “Baptist” and especially “Southern Baptist” are not and cannot be my ecclesiastical &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; unless they comes to mean something very different than they have for many years. In the meantime, I will remain a “Pres-matic Bap-terian”, and deeply grateful for the traditions that have shaped me and especially our current church—even when they are not a “perfect fit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology and Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two practices embraced universally throughout the Christian church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Even with these, serious differences remain, reflecting deeper distinctions in the theology and practice of the church. In the case of baptism, the questions of its meaning and mode tend to reflect the believer’s views on the nature of God’s saving work, the covenant community, and the church. Who should be baptized, and how, where, and under what circumstances are difficult, important questions. Believers must consider them carefully and hold their conclusions humbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptismal-theology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism should be applied to believers, and is best carried out by immersion. However, while Baptist churches have often tended toward a dogmatic position on these, leading to a frequent practice of rebaptism, more caution is necessary—especially on the second point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="meaning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the covenant sign of one’s entrance into the Christian faith, and also a means of grace in the life of the Christian—not &lt;em&gt;saving&lt;/em&gt; grace, but real grace nonetheless, in the same way that fellowship with the saints, the preaching of the word, and the Lord’s supper are.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; God works grace in the life of believers in their obedience to his commands, of which baptism is among the clearest in the New Testament (Matt. 28:18–20, Acts 2:38). Moreover, it is the symbol and in some mysterious way also a means of the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14), an element of his union with Christ’s church (Eph. 4:4–6), and his appeal to God for a pure conscience (1 Pet. 3:21–22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is not merely a symbolic ordinance&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but, as these passages make clear, a place in which God works uniquely in the life of the believer. Neither is paptism a work necessary for salvation, as is clear from the salvation of the thief on the cross (Luke 23:42–43, as well as from many other places that teach that faith alone is necessary for salvation). Nor is there warrant in Scripture for the idea that baptism is a means of regeneration or cleansing from original sin. Nonetheless, paptism is ordinarily a part of God’s saving work in his people’s lives. The reality that some are saved who are never baptized does not mean it plays no part in the believer’s life, but rather that its part is in &lt;em&gt;sanctification&lt;/em&gt; rather than in &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="mode" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all Baptists historically have argued on the basis of the New Testament language that baptism &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be by immersion. The word βαπτίζω, usually transliterated to English as “baptize” rather than translated, is a secondary verb derived from the root βάπτω, broadly meaning simply “to dip or immerse.” While a full exegetical treatment is beyond the scope of this essay, two points must be remembered in any discussion of baptism. First, the normal meaning of both these words &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dipping or immersion, and there are a number of examples which strongly suggest going down into and coming up out of standing water (Matt. 3:6–17, Mark 1:4–11, John 3:22, Acts 8:36–39). Second, however, the lexical domain of these verbs and of the various words derived from them within the New Testament alone is broader than dipping or immersion, and certainly includes the notion of washing.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, its figurative uses throughout the New Testament range far more broadly than “immersion” alone: it includes partaking of trials (Mark 10:38, Luke 12:50); the transfoming work of the Spirit (Matt. 3:11, Acts 1:5, Acts 11:16), and even the Israelites’ passing through water without getting wet (1 Cor. 10:2). The most significant of these metaphorical texts is Paul’s argument that in baptism believers have been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14). The parallel imagery between the two is clear and potent: baptism visualizes death and resurrection. However, Paul’s parallel uses of the word “baptism” and “baptize” (e.g. 1 Cor. 12:13, Gal. 3:27) with “in Christ” demonstrate that the point of these passages is union with Christ—not mode of baptism. Immersion illustrates this reality most effectively, but immersion is not commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be granted, then, that the primary meaning of the word group is of dipping or immersion, but that it also includes a broader sense of washing or transformation. Likewise, given what documents there are from the first and second century, it seems safe to say that baptism was normally by immersion in the early church. However, it is too much to say that immersion is &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; by the language used or by the examples in the New Testament. Rather, it should be preferred as the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way of expressing visually the death, burial and resurrection of the believer with Christ as well as the cleansing and transformative elements of the practice. At the same time, those who practice baptism by immersion should not reject baptisms by sprinkling or pouring as false or unbiblical baptisms.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="subject" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; of baptism is similarly heated. There are essentially two positions on who should be baptized (with some variations in each position): that only new believers should be baptized, or that new believers and the children of believers should be baptized. While there are some important differences regarding the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the baptism of believers, it is the universal practice of all Christian churches. The baptism of infants or as-yet-unbelieving children of newly converted parents, however, has been attributed a wide number of meanings, ranging from cleansing from original sin and the beginning of the individual’s own work of salvation (the Catholic view) to entrance into the covenant community conditioned on personal faith (the Presbyterian view).&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the vast majority of Christians throughout all history prior to the 20th century baptized infants. On the other hand, the believer is responsible finally to submit to the Bible, tradition notwithstanding; if the Scriptures teaches credobaptism, even the weight of so much tradition must be set aside. Nonetheless, church history is often illuminating for difficult interpretive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest unambiguous mention of infant baptism is Tertullian’s condemnation of the practice in 198 A.D. Less than two decades later, though, Hippolytus advocated the baptism of children incapable of answering for themselves less than two decades later (parents or other relatives were to speak on behalf of their children).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Some argue that the commands for those baptized in earlier documents such as the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; precludes children’s having been baptized, but this is an argument from silence—and these same kinds of commands appear in the “Apostolic Tradition” following the instruction regarding children. In any case, practice in the church was mixed by the end of the second century at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from New Testament practice is also ambiguous.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is true that in the cases where the recipients of baptism are clearly delineated, they are believers. However, any argument regarding the household baptisms is necessarily an argument from silence. There is no grounds in the text for asserting that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the households that received baptism included infants or small children incapable of professing faith.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To say otherwise is to read one’s theological presuppositions into the text. By the same token, however, paedobaptists have no more warrant than do credobaptists for claiming these passages as clear evidence for their view. Believers may of course argue that these passages should be interpreted in light of their understanding of the rest of the New Testament—but without the dogmatism too often present on both sides. The passages simply do not say; indeed, no passage in the New Testament even speaks clearly about believing children.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the subject of baptism can be determined only through the passages that teach about its meaning and function in the life of the believer. Covenantal paedobaptists&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argue that, in continuity with the pattern of the Abrahamic Covenant, children of believers—that is, children of those who are themselves members of the covenant community of faith—should be baptized. They note, rightly, that the major points of discontinuity marked off by the New Covenant are with the &lt;em&gt;Mosaic&lt;/em&gt; covenant rather than the Abrahamic Covenant. As such, they suggest that just as the (male) children of members of the Abrahamic covenant were circumcised to symbolize their entrance into the covenant community, so likewise (all) children of members of the New Covenant should be baptized. The covenant view rightly distinguishes between the role of the symbol and the necessary faith of the believer. It also rightly identifies the church with Abraham’s offspring (cf. Luke 3:7–9) and takes seriously the teaching in both Testaments that Abraham and his offspring were saved by faith, not merely by being members of the people of Israel (see esp. Gal. 3:1–6).&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the Abrahamic covenant led directly to the New Covenant, it nonetheless had an ethnic or national bent to it that the New Covenant does not. The Abrahamic covenant was with Abraham and his offspring in a specific nation, though for the good of all nations (Gen. 12:1–7, 15:1–21, 17:1–14). Circumcision was established for Abraham and his descendants as their act of covenant (Gen 17:9–14). Yet the New Testament unambiguously does away with circumcision as the mark of participation in God’s community (cf. Acts 10:1–48, 16:3, 1 Cor. 7:18, Gal. 2:3, 5:2). The New Covenant circumcision is one “made without hands” (Col. 2:11; cf. Deut. 30:6, Rom. 2:29) and is tied directly to baptism—“the circumcision of Christ” (Col. 2:11b–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant paedobaptist is right that baptism is to the church what circumcision was to the Jews, but wrong about how entrance into the covenant community now comes about.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: salvation was always by faith, but the people of God are no longer constituted ethnically or nationally, but by faith alone. To become one of God’s people in the Abrahamic covenant was to join the nation of Israel; even when, as in Ruth’s case, that commitment was one of faith it was also national and ethnic. It is no longer. Those who are to be baptized are those who have become disciples (Matt. 28:18–20), repented (Acts 2:38–39), been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3, Col 2:12), put on Christ (Gal. 3:27), asked God for cleansing from sin (Acts 22:17) and for a clear conscience (1 Pet. 3:21). In the New Covenant, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; those who profess faith are marked as belonging to the people of God.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the practice described in the New Testament, then, only believers should be baptized today: those who have made a clear and credible profession of faith. However, those who affirm believer’s baptism should be careful not to overstate their case. While the New Testament does incline this way, there is no slam-dunk case, and no therefore warrant for sneering at those who disagree. Moreover, other convictions held in light of one’s position on baptism must be held moderately, in light of the provisional character of the doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-rebaptism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Rebaptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebaptism is a serious matter. It argues that the first baptism a person underwent was not in fact a Christian baptism at all, for one should not otherwise be rebaptized. There is only one instance of rebaptism recorded in the New Testament: that of the believers in Ephesus (Acts 19), who had not been baptized in the name of Jesus at all. If the meaning, mode, and subject of baptism as outlined above are correct, then it is appropriate to rebaptize those who have been baptized as unbelievers (including as children) or by those who are not orthodox Christians (e.g. Mormons). However, it is inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized by a mode other than immersion,&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the mode of baptism is neither a primary issue nor a point asserted dogmatically anywhere in Scripture. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized as believers, but by churches holding differing views on the meaning of baptism but which are nonetheless true Christian churches. Any baptism applied to a believer on a valid profession of faith by a true church ought to be respected by other Christian churches.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptismal-practice" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="baptism-and-the-lords-supper" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Lord’s Supper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Baptists have argued that the Lord’s Supper should be reserved for those who have been baptized as believers, by immersion—a position that dates from the origin of Baptist life (in the writings of William Kiffen) to the present day (see the Baptist Faith and Message 2000 for just one example). A minority of Baptists throughout the history of the movement (famously including John Bunyan) have argued to the contrary: that the table ought to be open to any who have given a valid profession of faith, or are members in good standing of other Christian churches. Finally, a yet-smaller group has practiced local-church-only communion, in which only the members of a given congregation may partake of communion there. The first position, though most common, is perhaps least sustainable in the author’s view. The fully open and local-church-only views are more self-consistent in their interpretation of the relevant passages on the Lord’s Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those answering this question are attempting to deal rightly with the reality that coming to the Table is a serious matter. The New Testament teaches that Christians are not to partake of the meal with those who are in unrepentant sin (1 Cor. 5) and warns that judgment will come on those who themselves partake of the meal while unrepentant (1 Cor. 11:20–30). Moreover, unrepentant sin is the only boundary set around the table in the New Testament. But arguing that being mistaken about even a practice so central as baptism constitutes unrepentant sin is problematic. There are other doctrines of denomination-forming importance, and which believers regard as sin issues; if this logic were to be applied consistently, Christians could never share the Table with anyone who did not share their every denominational distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mike Bergman comments, the Lord’s Table is for disciples—for all those who will be eating the supper together when the Lord returns.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The “closed” communion position wrongly restricts the practice on the basis of a doctrinal distinctive—one having little to do with the meaning of the Table itself. Baptism is important, but to be incorrect on a secondary (albeit important) issue is not remotely as unrepentant sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of closed communion sometimes argue for a modified version of this position. Instead, they argue that participation in the Lord’s Supper requires that one already have been baptized, and that since paedobaptism or baptism by a mode other than immersion are by (their) definition not baptisms at all, such believers should not be admitted to the table.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, this is also problematic. First of all, it assumes facts not in evidence. The New Testament makes no comment on the issue whatsoever, presumably because it was not an issue (regardless of the question of credo- or paedobaptism), leaving one with no direct exegetical warrant for drawing the line here. Moreover, the result is to exclude from the table other believers whose faith in Christ one fully acknowledges and who one is confident will share in the feast at the end of ages—on the basis of a debated interpretive issue, where the New Testament draws no such line. Again, this reduces in no uncertain terms to the idea that doctrinal differences are sufficient for excluding people from the Table, and sets one rapidly on the path to sectarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, advocates of the local-church-only position rightly note that the local church, and especially her shepherds, have a responsibility for the souls of those who partake of the Table. Again, the New Testament is clear that partaking of the talbe in known, unrepentant sin is a cause for judgment; it is likewise clear that churches are as part of the practice of church discipline remove unrepentant members from the table. Since the local church cannot ordinarily know the spiritual condition of a visitor, it is safer to restrict communion only to those about whom the congregation does have knowledge: members. However, this position is similarly hard to sustain from the New Testament. While churches are to remove from membership and access to the table those who are in unrepentant sin, there is no indication of restricting the Table only to those in the local congregation. Moreover, the text most often cited as evidence for this position (1 Cor. 11:28) actually speaks to individuals holding themselves accountable, rather than to churches holding their members accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the New Testament pattern is indeed of baptism, the question once again is whether the issue of baptism is so certain as to warrant this kind of restriction. If, as argued above, there are grounds for holding a credobaptist position only with considerable humility, Christians must likewise take care not to draw too thick a line around other elements of the church’s practice on the basis of baptismal doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptism-and-the-local-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Local Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the same arguments applied to the Lord’s Supper have been applied to the issue of church membership, and many of the same concerns are in play. However, many Baptist churches today practice open communion but closed membership, and a number of high-profile Baptist leaders throughout history have advocated for open membership as well as open communion.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Baptists have universally argued for a regenerate church membership, and believer’s baptism by immersion has &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; been understood to be a prerequisite for membership, since other forms of baptism have been deemed invalid.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, since a local church is not merely a group of believers who happen to come together, but a group united around common affirmations about the nature of the Christian life and the truths Scripture teaches, local churches rightly have a higher bar for membership than merely that a person appears truly to be saved.&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches should certainly not admit to membership those who affirm their stance on baptism yet continue to refuse it. In cases where the person affirms paedobaptism, though, membership may not be wholly out of bounds—for the same reason that the Lord’s supper is not: the unity of the body of Christ matters enormously. It will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; be best in such circumstances to direct the individual to another evangelical church in the area that practices paedobaptism.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This best reflects the importance and seriousness of baptism. However, there may be times when the best option is to admit such an individual to membership—e.g., in cases where the baptistic church is the evangelical congregation in the area. Baptism is important, but not so important as to leave a regenerate individual or family without fellowship. Until Christ returns and finally sets all doctrines aright, people should gather with those with whom they share core doctrinal affiliations where possible—and be welcomed as brothers and sisters in Christ where it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible. Such a practice may, by the grace of God, be used a little to knit together again the fractured body of the church catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="is-baptism-a-church-ordinance" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is baptism a church ordinance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believers argue that baptism is specifically a church ordinance, and as such that it should never (or only in very rare circumstances) be carried out outside the church. Since baptism is the believer’s initiation into the church, it is the right only of the church to carry it out.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, in nearly every case in the New Testament, the newly baptized believers constituted the first members of the church, and baptism is rarely mentioned outside of “church planting” narratives. In the few cases where baptisms in the local church &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discussed (1 Cor. 15:29), the content is simply not relevant. Indeed, Jesus himself presided over (but did not participate in) a great many baptisms prior to the formation of the local church, and evidently to a different end than “Christian baptism”—certainly the symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection with Christ remained hidden from those recipients of baptism. As with John’s baptism, this seems to have been a baptism “for repentance from sins” (Mark 1:4). Given the relative silence of Scripture on the subject, it again seems best not to stake out too strong a position on who may and may not baptize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the normal circumstance will be baptism in the context of a local church, because the local church is the home of Christian ministry. However, this is not a normative practice; should a person come to faith in the context of a parachurch ministry, there is no basis for arguing that it is &lt;em&gt;categorically&lt;/em&gt; wrong for the parachurch ministry to perform the convert’s baptism. To be sure, a parachurch ministry that consistently baptizes new converts may run the risk of usurping the church’s role—but in this case, the baptismal practice is a reflection of the problem, not itself the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Age for Baptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the credo-baptist position that only those who have made a credible profession of faith should be baptized, the question arises: how old must someone be to offer a profession that the church deems credible and therefore administers baptism? Put negatively, is there an age below which such a baptism would be more akin to paedo- than to credobaptism? Or should any profession of faith be accepted, regardless of the child’s age? There are a number of good arguments in favor of baptizing even very young children after a clear profession of faith.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, there is no evidence in Scripture for delaying baptism after clear professions of faith: baptism normally followed a profession of faith immediately.&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Second, delaying baptism as a sort of “litmus test” for baptism implies that something besides repentance and faith in Christ is necessary for salvation. Third, it is not giving false assurance to affirm even a child’s trust in Christ through the gospel—perhaps even to the contrary (Mark 10:13–16). Moreover, the New Testament pattern for confirmation of salvation is always a matter of encouraging those who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; made a profession to hold fast to it (cf. Heb. 2, 4, 6, 10), rather than discouraging people from profession or baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also a number of reasons to consider delaying baptism for children.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One caution against baptizing young adults who have made a profession is the historic practice of baptistic churches, and that of many baptistic churches outside the United States, where baptism has been and remains a matter for adulthood. Another is the reality that young children, being easily swayed by their parents or peers, might be inclined to make false professions of faith—even apparently sincere ones. Of course, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; profession of faith may be made for the wrong reasons.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not the church’s job to prevent false profession from being made, but to respond appropriately when a false profession has been made (Matt. 18, 1 Cor. 5). Moreover, as noted above, Scripture is simply silent on the age of non-adults baptized, so making a hard and fast rule is unwarranted. It may nonetheless be wise to baptize only individuals who are judged capable of making their own professions of faith—perhaps those in their early pre-teen years and onward, as judged together by parents and church leaders in each case.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the sign of the New Covenant, and should be applied to the members of that covenant: believers. The preferred mode is immersion, but other modes may be allowed if circumstances demand. Similarly, the church is the ordinary context and her members the normal adminstrators of baptism, but it matters most that a person be baptized by an orthodox Christian in the Trinitarian formula. Those who have been baptized as believers ought not be rebaptized, regardless of mode. Those who have not been baptized as believers may partake of the Lord’s table, but should not ordinarly become members of a Baptist church. In all these things, the people of God ought to rejoice in their participation in the death and resurrection of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper belongs in a distinct category, insofar as it is a means of &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; grace in the Christian life, but it fits in this list as well.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra Thomas White, “What Makes Baptism Valid?” in &lt;em&gt;Restoring Integrity in Baptist Churches&lt;/em&gt;, eds. Thomas White, Jason G. Duesing, and Malcolm B. Yarnell, III (Grand Rapids: Kregel Publications, 2008), 110–111.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See e.g. Luke 11:38, where it is clear the Pharisees were not surprised that Jesus failed to take a whole-body bath; or Mark 7:4, where the same word is used of washing after returning from the market; or Hebrews 6:2, 9:10, where it refers to ritual purification&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the pattern of the early church, as evidenced by the very early “Didache”, which argued for baptism by immersion if possible and by pouring if necessary (&lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; 7).&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be taken as a secondary argument against paedobaptism—a point made to the author and others by Nathan Finn in a number of personal conversations and in several class lectures, 2013–2015.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Stanton Norman, &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way: Distinctives of a Baptist Church&lt;/em&gt; (Nashville: Broadman &amp;amp; Holman Publishers, 2005), 110–112; White, 109–110.&lt;a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Norman, 110–111.&lt;a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearest the New Testament comes to it are: Jesus’ welcome of little children (Mark 10:13–16), Paul’s admonitions to those married to unbelievers for the sake of their spouse and children (1 Cor. 7:12–16), and Paul’s instructions to presumably believing children and their parents (Eph. 6:1–4, Col. 3:20–21) .&lt;a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For constraints of time and space, the author has left aside other views, many of which are both historically and practically significant and deserves serious interaction, but which have in the author’s view less Scriptural warrant (to varying degrees) than the covenant position.&lt;a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also perhaps surprising that in all the controversy stirred up by the Judaizers in the early church, there is no mention of hostility over children being excluded from the New Covenant—a fairly striking change between the two. This is especially so given that the distinction between Old and New Covenants did not preclude the Judaizers from arguing for many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; points of even stronger continuity between Mosaic practice and that of the church—still less Abrahamic practice and that of the church. However, this is another argument from silence and so cannot be taken as strong evidence one way or the other. (Personal conversation with Doug Serven, August 5, 2010.)&lt;a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contested passages in Acts are left aside because, as has been noted, they do not prove what either side claims they do. Lydia believed, and her household was baptized—does this mean her household had no infants in it and everyone in it converted with her? It is impossible to say.&lt;a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Nathan Finn, “A Baptist perspective on -re-baptism-”, BRNow.org, posted February 25, 2013, http://www.brnow.org/Opinions/Guest-Columns/February-2013/A-Baptist-perspective-on-re-baptism (accessed March 28, 2015).&lt;a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, partly begs the question, for it leaves aside the matter of what constitutes a “true Christian church”—certainly a contested issue, and one beyond the scope of this paper. At a minimum, no group which rejects orthodox Trinitarianism and Christology may be included. At most, some major denominations may be excluded. The author is inclined to treat believers’ baptisms even by groups with serious doctrinal problems such as Roman Catholics as valid, however, so long as the specific congregation by which the believer was baptized rightly proclaimed a gospel of repentance from sins and salvation through the finished work of Christ alone.&lt;a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

He is one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; pastors. This makes the task of writing a critical book review somewhat strange. On the one hand, I wanted to write this review as I would any such. On the other hand, I wanted to take care to show respect to a man whom God has used to shepherd me and my family for the past two years since we moved to North Carolina, and whom I regard very highly for his faithfulness in serving the church gathered as First Baptist Church of Durham. I hope I have struck the balance appropriately. And as I hope will become clear, though there were a few places where this book could be stronger, it is nonetheless extraordinarily valuable. I have been challenged and indeed have grown in holiness because of having read it. I commend it to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey: Growing toward Christlikeness&lt;/em&gt;, by Andrew M. Davis, Greenville: Ambassador International, 2014, 480 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Davis’ &lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a careful, thorough, heavy exploration of the doctrine and practice of sanctification in the Christian life. Davis, the long-time pastor of First Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina and an adjunct professor at nearby Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, has clearly dedicated considerable time and consideration to the topic of holiness and growth in the Christian life, and this consideration is on display throughout what is ultimately a very helpful book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis begins by introducing the concepts which permeate the rest of the book: the saving work of God in Christ and the Christian’s lasting dependence on the Holy Spirit. Perhaps surprisingly (at least to the casual reader), he opens not with the topic of sanctification, but with justification, arguing that all real Christian growth must be predicated on a right understanding of the gospel. Thus, he spends some time tracing out the story of salvation, culminating in Christ’s atoning death on the cross and resurrection, and his institution of the church and sending the Holy Spirit to save and then shape the internal lives of Christians throughout the ages. He further argues that all Christians are involved in two “infinite journeys”—the external journey of evangelism and discipleship, and the internal journey of growth in holiness. Both, he notes, are essential for the health of the Christian: to be deficient in either is to demonstrate either ignorance or hard-heartedness toward the things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, Davis turns to a map of the second of these journeys: the internal path of growing Christ-likeness. His thesis is that sanctification is a four-part process, involving a continuous sequence of knowledge, faith, character, and action, each feeding into the next. Knowledge of God produces faith; increasing faith produces Christlike character; a more Christlike character results in more Godward actions; and those Godward actions in turn lead to a greater knowledge of God himself. Davis dedicates a section of the book to each of these ideas, examining in detail Scriptural support for the concept and then examples of the element in the lives of figures in Scripture, especially Christ. Finally, he turns to a section dedicated to application, looking at the knowledge-faith-character-action cycle as a whole in both Scripture and a variety of day-to-day scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis’ treatment of the doctrines of sanctification is thorough and compelling, most of all because it is drenched in Scripture. Early in the book, Davis explicitly spells out his commitment to the centrality, sufficiency, and authority of Scripture, and the text of the book backs this up. It is common to hear authors affirm the importance of Scripture; it is rare to see it so born out so clearly in their writing. Even apart from the explicit references on nearly every page, the text bears the unmistakable imprint of Davis’ own practice of memorizing books of the Bible. Allusions, near quotes, and implicit references to Scripture appear multiple times on nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Scriptural emphasis leads to the book’s other great strengths. First, Davis makes no point without basing the assertion on Scripture, and he draws on every section of the Bible to demonstrate the importance of each aspect of his map for growth in holiness. Moreover, he follows Scripture’s lead in grounding sanctification in the work of Christ mediated to us by the Holy Spirit. Davis’ emphasis on the work of the Spirit is especially helpful. Though he is by no means a charismatic in the modern sense of the word, it is clear that he is gripped by the reality that sanctification simply does not happen without the work of the Holy Spirit. This is an essential corrective for two kinds of churches: those tempted to ignore the Spirit, and those tempted to ignore all the works of the Spirit apart from those that result in visible signs. Rightly, Davis’ doctrine of sanctification is trinitarian: holy people whole-heartedly worship the Father in Spirit-empowered dependence on the finished work of the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this Scriptural care allows Davis to navigate the difficult topic of Spirit-dependent human effort that characterizes Biblical sanctification. Because sanctification is the one aspect of salvation in which people are called to work (e.g. in Phil. 2:12), many believers are tempted to treat sanctification as a wholly human endeavor. Davis repudiates this notion, showing again and again that sanctification—like the justification that precedes it and the glorification that will follow it—is ultimately a work of God and one that brings him all glory. No person will be able to claim the credit for their own sanctification before God at the day of judgment. At the same time, he also rejects a Keswickian spirituality (“let go and let God”), even when dressed up as mere gospel dependence. However much in vogue the notion may be that we can do nothing and God does everything for us, it is simply not true. God requires us actively to seek him and his holiness. Davis rightly recognizes both these dangers and charts a course between them. The pursuit of holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit, and believers must always fix their eyes on the finished work of Christ and the promise of future glory. Yet believers keep their eyes on Christ and rely on the Spirit &lt;em&gt;to work&lt;/em&gt;—not to sit still and trust God to float them toward holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have a few weaknesses. First, although the book’s length and thoroughness are valuable in many ways, they also make this a difficult sell for anyone who is not already a dedicated reader. Moreover, while much of the length was inevitable in a work this thorough on a topic this complex, the book could be substantially shorter were it edited more carefully. Trimming the lengthy introduction and removing some repetition, unnecessary explanations, and clarifications would make the work stronger as well as shorter and more approachable. Given Davis’ goals—to stir up believers to pursuing holiness—this would be profoundly helpful, as it would allow for the book to be used in a broader variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a number of Davis’ references to words’ meanings in Greek are either extraneous or inaccurate. In particular, he regularly committed the so-called etymological fallacy, ascribing meaning to words based on their components rather than their actual use in the language. (This led him several times to disagree with every modern major translation!) He also sometimes referenced English words derived from Greek terms, but in cases where the derivation is irrelevant to the present meaning of the English word (e.g. &lt;em&gt;poem&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;poiema&lt;/em&gt;). Gladly, no major issues in the text hung on these cases. Nonetheless, the misuses were distracting, and since in most cases they were also unnecessary, they actually &lt;em&gt;weakened&lt;/em&gt; the book for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That these are the only significant issues in such a large and thorough book is a significant achievement, and both could readily be addressed in future editions of the work. Taken as a whole, Davis’ book shines. As Davis points out, holiness necessarily entails both knowledge of the things of God and zeal for his glory. The book drips with Davis’ passion for God and his urgent desire that God’s people seek holiness, and it lays out a thoughtful and (most importantly) Scriptural plan for how his people shall become holy. Lord willing, the volume will be a reliable guide to sanctification for the church for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

In this reading, the New Covenant is specific to the work of Christ in the New Testament age, and was never experienced by any “Old Testament believers”. Those believers remained under the previous (Abrahamic and especially Mosaic and Davidic) covenants, while New Testament believers are New Covenant believers. For this view, they draw on the ways that the New Covenant language was picked up by the authors of the New Testament, especially in Hebrews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this reading has an ancient pedigree, going back at least as far as Jerome, it is ultimately incorrect. First, it fails to take the content of Jeremiah’s vision on its own terms. As Jeremiah traces out his vision of the New Covenant in chapters 31–33, he explicitly includes the language of law-keeping, temple working and priests, and a Davidic king over the land of Israel. These were not merely symbolic expectations, but fully fleshed out hopes for and visions of a restoration of the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. Indeed, the terms of priestly temple sacrifice and law-keeping used throughout the section presuppose the covenant language of Deuteronomy and the discussion in Deuteronomy 30 of the circumcised heart. Thus, Hill and Walton note (and likewise Thomas suggested) that in many ways it is more appropriate to speak of a &lt;em&gt;renewed&lt;/em&gt; covenant than of a totally &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the reading of the ‘New Covenant’ as &lt;em&gt;wholly&lt;/em&gt; new misses the ways the other authors of the Old Testament responded to this promise. In particular, Ezra’s prayer in Ezra-Nehemiah makes it abundantly clear that he considered the people’s return to the land after their 70-year-exile a fulfillment of the prophecy. If it was not a complete fulfillment—as indeed that same prayer acknowledges, for the people’s hearts were still wayward—it nonetheless represented at least a partial fulfillment. There were once again Jewish people living in the land, performing temple sacrifice and following Yahweh. Though the Davidic king had not yet been reinstated, and though the people’s hearts had not yet had the law so thoroughly stamped on them that they no longer needed teachers, the promise was partly fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, even in the age after Christ’s coming it is clear that the vision remains only fulfilled in part. True: there was a significant break in the shape of history in the incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension of the Son. Yet God’s law is not yet written so thoroughly on anyone’s heart that no man needs to teach his neighbor. Christians still wrestle with sin. Moreover, as the author of Hebrews notes, this Davidic king who fulfills the New Covenant hopes has not yet put everything in subjection under his feet (Heb. 2). He is seated at the right hand of God, exalted above the heavens, and has inaugurated his reign, but he has not yet &lt;em&gt;consummated&lt;/em&gt; reign. The same author who affirms so strongly that Jesus is the fulfillment of the New Covenant hope affirms as well that the New Covenant is not yet fully completed. The ancient Jews lived in an “already but not yet” after the return from Exile. In the work of Christ, that “already” is significantly advanced—but the “not yet” remains until he returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; new about the New Covenant. Unlike in Deuteronomy 30, where the people were enjoined to repent and circumcise their own hearts, the work in Jeremiah’s vision is wholly God’s. Too, the New Testament’s embrace of New Covenant language in terms of Jesus’ work means that Christians &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; understand that something new has happened in Christ. Specifically, Christ has done what Israel could not. Jesus kept the law perfectly, needing no one to teach him; he served as both priest and sacrifice to make atonement for the sins of the people; he rules and judges righteously as the Davidic Branch who represents Yahweh; he even reconstituted Israel in his twelve disciples. Jesus Messiah &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the fulfillment of the New Covenant. He is the hope toward which the Old Testament saints looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine, not Jerome, had the right of it. All the Old Testament saints were participants in the New Covenant. They looked forward to that which they did not see, but they too were saved by faith in Christ. They did not have the full revelation with which New Testament saints are blessed. They saw from far off that of which Christians now enjoy the fullness. But Jesus’ work in bringing about the New Covenant was not something foreign to the covenants that had gone before; it was the fulfillment of all of them. Here was the offspring of the woman who would crush the serpent’s head, the offspring of Abraham in whom all nations would be blessed, the prophet like Moses who would give the law anew, the true Israel who would keep the law rightly, the offspring of David who would do justice for his people and for the nations. Jeremiah’s New Covenant promised the fulfillment of what had gone before. It was new in that Jesus finally accomplished what no Israelite ever had. It was the renewal of the old in that what Jesus accomplished was precisely the hope set before Israel from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I. The Centrality and Uniqueness of the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation of the Son of God is the ground of all Christian hope. It is the “central miracle asserted by Christians.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Without the Incarnation, there would be no salvation. Not only would the other aspects of redemption (Christ’s life, teaching, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension) not be possible, but parts of the restoration of humanity hinge on the Incarnation itself. The Incarnation was a unique event in history, with unique theological significance. At no other time has God manifested himself as a human being. The Spirit’s present indwelling of all believers is a direct result of and carries forward the reconciliation of divinity and humanity that occured in the person of Jesus Christ. A healthy church depends on a healthy Christology, for it is only in Christ and by Christ’s Spirit that the church exists—and there can be no healthy Christology without a robust doctrine of the Incarnation. It is in the Incarnation that Jesus the Messiah must be understood: a single person uniting all that it is to be God and all that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-biblical-affirmations" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Biblical Affirmations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospels opens in a way that emphasizes the unique nature of Jesus Christ. Matthew begins with a genealogy that situates him in the story of Israel, then immediately shows in narrative that from his conception he was also divine (Matt. 1–2, esp. 1:1, 1:23). Mark, ever brief, introduces the Messiah with the astounding words, “Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Luke inverts Matthew’s order: miraculous birth first, genealogy second. He situations Jesus not only in Israel’s story but in humanity’s, tracing his lineage to Adam (Luke 1:26–28, 2:8–38, 3:23–38). John reaches out to Greek philosophy and turns it on its head, proclaiming the coming of the uncreated &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; into creation (John 1:1–18). The sum effect of the gospel-tellers is to emphasize that in Jesus Christ, something profoundly unique had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nowhere are the importance and uniqueness of the Incarnation more evident than in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The anonymous letter emphasizes from its first words the uniqueness of Jesus’ incarnation and ministry (Heb. 1:1–2). It argues that the Incarnation was essential to his roles as priest (2:17–18, 4:15, 5:5–10, 7:26–8:2), destroyer of death (2:14–15), and propitiatory sacrifice (2:9, 7:27, 9:11–28, 10:12–14, 10:19–22). It is not only that Jesus died to save people from their sins, but that he became human and lived to that end and more besides—a consistent theme throughout the New Testament. Thus, Zechariah’s prophecy (Luke 1:76–79) includes salvation from sin, but also light coming into the world, death’s power coming to an end, and peace reigning in the cosmos. Likewise, John couples the Incarnation to the doctrine of adoption (John 1:12). Paul exults in the Incarnation as the grounds of the reconciliation of all things, humanity included (Col 1:19–20). Moreover, he explicitly couples the Messiah’s full humanity to humans being filled in him in turn (Col. 2:9–10)—a theme Peter picks up as well, noting that the saints actually become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the New Testament affirms that the Incarnation itself was an essential element in the salvation of humanity—not merely as a prerequisite for other parts of Christ’s work. The Incarnation is the means by which human nature is brought once again into fellowship with the Godhead. Christ is the eschatological firstfruits of this restoration. As he is, so will all the saints be in glory: restored to unbroken fellowship between humanity and humanity’s Creator.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-the-theology-of-the-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. The Theology of the Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the Incarnation has been affirmed by the church throughout her history. The Church Fathers fleshed out the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation over the first four centuries of the history of the church, with various controversies erupting every century.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This work culminated in the lasting affirmations and denials of the Chalcedonian formula.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, nearly every theological controversy in the early church was a Christological controversy, and every such controversy hinged on issues pertaining to the nature of the Incarnation. The Fathers recognized that the details of God’s becoming man were essentials of the faith. The hope of human salvation would be lost entirely if Jesus were not a single person in whom “all the fullness of deity dwells bodily” (Col. 2:9) and who “likewise partook of [flesh and blood]” (Heb. 2:14).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incarnational thoelogizing did not end in the patristic period; it has remained foundational for further reflection on the natures of God and humanity. Indeed, patristic theology has been influential on nearly every major orthodox theologian since the Reformation—whether directly or mediated by the Reformers. Athanasius’ Christology, with its emphasis on the transformational effect of the Incarnation itself on humanity’s state,&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has proven particularly influential. If advocates of “incarnational” theologies have sometimes pressed this recovery in unhelpful directions (see below), they have also provided a helpful reminder of what God’s becoming man has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; accomplished: the first step of the eschatological transformation of humanity. “The crucified Christ stands in solidarity with humanity, not merely as ane xample of confrontation with the world to be imitated by us &lt;em&gt;but as the reality of new humanity in which we may and must participate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jesus’ humanity is an essential ingredient in human salvation and in the sanctified life of the believer in the present—the Spirit mediating Christ’s humanity to the believer’s—as well as of a glorified reality in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ii.-in-life-and-ministry" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II. In Life and Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the importance—indeed, the essential character—of the doctrine of the Incarnation, it is clear that the church must strive to maintain the doctrine. It is insufficent only to affirm it in principle; the church must cherish this reality in practice and protect it from loss. Unfortunately, both in the Western church broadly and in evangelicalism in particular, the centrality and uniqueness of the Incarnation have sometimes been lost through neglect or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-absence" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Absence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may first of all fail with regard to its theology of the Incarnation by losing it, whether by doctrinal negation or by simple unobservance. The threat of outright denial of the doctrine has been dangerously common in church history. As noted above, many of the early Christological heresies relted directly to the nature of the Incarnation, and variations on these heresies have continued to arise to the present day. In the Reformation era, for example, the Anabaptist movement included many who affirmed a “heavenly flesh” view in which Jesus was not Mary’s descendant but sent from heaven without human parentage whatsoever—a loss of Christ’s full humanity. More recently, both Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses have affirmed adoptionist views—a loss of Christ’s full deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-supernatural bent of many liberal theologies in the last several centuries has similarly resulted in a rejection of the doctrine of the Incarnation. For many liberals theologians, Jesus was representative of the God-consciousness in us all at its best and adopted by God as a special figure in human history accordingly.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any such outright rejection clearly results in the loss of all that the doctrine entails—not least any hope of real salvation. If Jesus was merely a man who was particularly helpful or holy, he could not redeem other humans. He could at best set others a good example. His death and his resurrection&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can have symbolic power only. They do not save. They inspire or impress at best, and intimidate with their inimitability at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All such views leave those who embrace them without ultimate salvific hope. As Gregory Nazianzen commented during the Arian controversy, “For that which He has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.”&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though no conservative scholars would actively deny the importance of the Incarnation, their passive neeglect can be nearly as problematic. Sadly, the doctrine receives receives little attention among evangelicals. The crucicentric bent of the evangelical movement has often led to other aspects of the Son’s work being overlooked, so that the Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ are all often treated as mere prerequisites for or accessories to his atoning death.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even when unintentional, this loss-by-neglect results in real problems in the church’s understanding of God’s work in Christ and humanity. Many of the borderline gnostic tendencies latent in evangelical theology eschatology, and the corresponding spiritualization and de-physicalization of evangelical eschatology, must be laid at least in part at the feet of a deficient theology of the Incarnation. This can only lead to a dimming of future hope—who really wants to be a disembodied spirit somehow strumming a harp forever?—which in turn produces real challenges in the life and faith of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-incarnational-theology-a-two-fold-error" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. “Incarnational Theology”: A Two-Fold Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may also err by misapplying its theology of the Incarnation. It has become increasingly common to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: Christians ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to humanity.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate recognition that humans are God’s image-bearers. It pays heed to the New Testament’s assertion that Christians are representatives of Christ. It takes seriously Paul’s shocking language of “filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions” (Col. 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet for all that, applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this kind of “incarnational” language is a misapplication of Paul’s “body” metaphor for the church, contra the proponents of “incarnational theology”, and notwithstanding Scripture’s many calls to imitate Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Paul uniformly used the language to teach the unity of the people of God—never evangelism. The authors of the New Testament chose other images for proclaiming Christ instead: fishermen (Matt. 4:19), harvest workers (Luke 10:2), servants working in the absence of their master (Matt. 24:45–51), or ambassadors and representatives (2 Cor. 5:20)—to name just a few. At no point, though, does the Bible use the metaphor of the body to describe Christian witness to the world. Nor does it support the idea that ordinary men and women can mediate the presence of God to people. The Incarnation may (and indeed should) prompt evangelism, but this response is not itself “incarnational.” The people of God do not incarnate God the Son, but represent him in other ways. That does not negate the helpful instincts expressed in the incarnational theologizing of the last few years. It simply means that this doctrine can be expressed more accurately and helpfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the church loses a great deal when incarnational theology is about anyone other than Jesus. God becoming man was an astounding and singular event. As Lewis commented, “It was the central event in the history of the Earth—the very thing that the whole story has been about.”&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When theologians speak of “incarnating” Christ, the sheer shock of the event fades. The focus shifts from the Son’s work in humanity to the human response to the Son. The doctrine of the Incarnation above all ought to lead to worship born of reflection not on human endeavors, but on divine intervention to undo human brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="iii.-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the centrality of the Incarnation and its uniqueness are essential to healthy Christian theology. A robust doctrine of the Incarnation leads to greater worship and deeper future hope. Understood rightly, it leads to deeper faith in the Word who “became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14), and so to more faithful obedience to the gospel. The believer seeks peace and justice and above all that others may know Christ not because the he himself incarnates Christ, but because the Incarnation has produced a radical transformation in his life (and in the lives of all who believe). “Christ gives his sanctified humanity to us, so that we may partake of him and his goodness…. God assumed our umanity in Jesus of Nazareth, healed our humanity with his own being, and gave our sanctified humanity back to us.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The church must therefore take care to protect the doctrine, both from reject or loss through neglect and from misappropriations of the language of incarnation that distract from the work of the Son. The Incarnation itself is essential and central in God’s work in the life of believers. It must never be obscured, diminished, or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="appendix-the-chalcedonian-definition" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Appendix: The Chalcedonian Definition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For the synod is opposed to those who presume to rend asunder the mystery of the Incarnation into a double Sonship, and it deposes from the priesthood those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only-begotten is passible; and it withstands those who imagine a mixing or confusion of the two natures of Christ; and it drives away those who erroneously teach that the form of a servant which he took from us was of a heavenly or some other substance; and it anathematizes those who feign that the Lord had two natures before the union, but that these were fashioned into one after the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore, following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, the same perfect in Godhead, the same perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man, the same consisting of a reasonable soul and a body, of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, the same of one substance with us as touching the manhood, like us in all things apart from sin; begotten of the Father before the ages as touching the Godhead, the same in the last days, for us and for our salvation, born from the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, as touching the manhood, one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being in no way abolished because of the union, but rather the characteristic property of each nature being preserved, and concurring into one Person and one subsistence (ὑπόστασις), not as if Christ were parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as the Prophets from the beginning spoke concerning him, and our Lord Jesus Christ instructed us, and the Creed of the Fathers has handed down to us.&lt;/p&gt;

The properties of divinity and humanity &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; fully existed in Jesus the Messiah; they did not cross into each other, but were united in the Son. The Son then could choose to use whichever attributes were appropriate to him at a given time: he could both ride in a boat (consistent with being a human being) or forgive sins (consistenly only with being God). This carries through to all aspects of the Son’s work upon his incarnation: he has a human will and a divine will, neither of which overrides the other but both of which are exercised together as appropriate. The divine will is already in line with the will of the Father; the human will he chooses to subject to the Father. By analogy: one may know both English and French, and if so one speaks each language as appropriate—there is no implied division in a person simply because he knows more than one language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This communication of attributes was accomplished so that no part of either the Son’s pre-existing humanity divinity or newly-embraced humanity was either changed or diminished in the Incarnation. The two were &lt;em&gt;united&lt;/em&gt;, but they were not altered or subsumed. This important reality was articulated in the four negations of the Chalcedonian definition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without confusion&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like mixing wine and water to produce a &lt;em&gt;tertium quid&lt;/em&gt;, a third thing like both of the others but not actually either of them, even while no longer distinguishable from each other. Jesus was both God and man, not a new thing that was neither wholly God nor wholly man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without diminishing&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like putting a drop of wine in the ocean so that the wine simply dissipates and is meaningless. Thus Apollinarian view that the Son’s divine nature subsumed and overwhelmed the human nature was rejected. In Jesus both human and divine natures were fully present, and neither overwhelmed the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without mixture&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not the result of combining two things that were unlike to produce a new thing which could still be separated into the old things. In other words, the Son’s becoming man was not like sodium joining with chloride to produce salt, which is entirely different from either sodium or chloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jesus, the two natures were united &lt;em&gt;without separating&lt;/em&gt;. The Incarnation was not like bundling together a pair of sticks which could just as easily be pulled apart. The Son did not shed his humanity upon his resurrection or his ascension; he remains now and forever a human being as well as divine. Thus all the experiences, actions, and sayings of Jesus are attributable to one person (rather than suggesting that the divine Son did some things and the human being did another—one stick and another stick acting in distinct ways). Rather, one person, Jesus, walked (and walks) with both natures, lived (and lives) both kinds of lives, existed (and exists) in both ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the attributes of God and of humanity were both &lt;em&gt;communicated&lt;/em&gt;—they had communion—in Christ. In Jesus, the human and divine did not mingle into a distinctionless soup, did not overwhelm each other, cannot be separated, and did not create some new thing unlike human or God. Jesus is fully God and fully man, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS]</category></item><item><title>Perfectionism</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/perfectionism.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of perfectionism suggests that believers ultimately come to a point in their &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; walk with God where they stop willfully sinning. This stands in contrast to non-perfectionistic views which believe the end of willful sin comes only at &lt;em&gt;glorification&lt;/em&gt; after one’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern perfectionism was advocated by John Wesley at some points during his ministry and adopted as a hallmark of the Wesleyan tradition (though Wesley himself abandoned the view late in life). In the Wesleyan view, the believer at some point during his life experiences a “second blessing” in which the Holy Spirit supernaturally empowers the believer to overcome the rest of his natural (fleshly) tendency toward sin. This moment must be apprehended by the believer in faith—it is not guaranteed to all believers but is granted to those who seek it in faith. The Wesleyans draw this view primarily from the apostle John’s note that “No one who lives in [Christ] keeps on sinning” (1 John 3:6), as well as from various other passages which suggest that Christians may &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; sinning. Moreover, they note the biblical commands to holiness and argue that these strongly imply (if not demand) that believers be able actually to live truly holy lives. Thus, believers should pray regularly for this empowering act of the Spirit in their lives so that they may fulfill God’s will that they be truly holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view has some significant and serious problems, not least in the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the book from which they primarily draw their support: John himself notes that when (not if) believers sin, they have an advocate with the Father in the person of Jesus himself (1 John 2:1). Similarly, the testimony of Paul and his ongoing struggles with sin after conversion and his explicit denial of having reached perfection (cf. Romans 7, Philippians 2) indicates that even for extraordinarily faithful believers, perfection will remain an unfilled but longed-for state until death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, the view readily leads to frustration and even despair on the one hand or profound hubris on the other. Those who, despite their pleading and (true!) faith do not have any experience of “second blessing” and instead remain aware of their ongoing struggle with sin may find themselves thinking they are simply weak in the faith and that they will never accomplish God’s plan for their holiness. This could not be further from the truth: those most faithfully walking with God are in fact those &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; aware of their own sinfulness. On the other hand, those who think they have found this holiness end up self-deceived. They proclaim their own sinlessness, and prove hypocrites. They may end up holding themselves up as superior to others (even if only in their own minds). They certainly will not go on as they ought in the process of mortifying their own sins, because they are convinced they have none.&lt;/p&gt;

There are several reasons why Christians have always affirmed and indeed &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; affirm the deity of Christ. First, Scripture itself clearly testifies to the fully deity of Jesus as the Son of God. To name just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Incarnation passage in John&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas’ outburst of faith, “My lord and my God!” to Jesus upon his resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas’ outburst of faith, “My lord and my God!” to Jesus upon his resurrection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the quotes throughout the New Testament but especially in Hebrews where God is quoted as addressing Jesus as God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the quotes throughout the New Testament but especially in Hebrews where God is quoted as addressing Jesus as God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the obvious reality that the early church prayed to and worshipped Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Christian is first of all obliged by the Scriptures to acknowledge Jesus as God. Beyond this, however, is the reason that it had to be God Incarnate who saved human beings and not merely another human being (still less any other created thing). First, salvation entails reconciliation between God and humanity. That is, the salvation Christ accomplished was not only between God and human beings as individuals, but between God and &lt;em&gt;human nature&lt;/em&gt; which was broken in the fall and separated from God in whose image it was made. That Christ is the image of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15, Hebrews 1:3) is not only an affirmation of the nature of the divine Son but an affirmation of the restored humanity of Jesus the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Jesus was a substitution for human sins. For this he of course had to be a human being (as the author of Hebrews notes: the blood of sheep and goats could not make purification for human sins). However, he had also to be God. Even if one mere human lived a perfectly sinless life, this perfect life would not be transferrable to another human being: it would be his alone, and would have no extra righteousness to give to another. But Jesus is fully God, and has &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; righteousness. Indeed, it is the righteousness of God—infinite, boundless, untainted by sin—that Christians receive by faith. It is not one man’s righteousness somehow wafted across a courtroom (to borrow N. T. Wright’s metaphor), but the righteousness of God in which humans participate because they are united with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Jesus came to overcome death. To die, he had to be a man, but to bring life he had to be God. Human beings do not have in themselves the power of life (still less to overcome death)—but God whose very name is “I AM”/“HE IS” has life in himself. Jesus the divine Son had and has life &lt;em&gt;in himself&lt;/em&gt;, and he therefore can and did overcome death. In his restored humanity, death no longer has any power. His resurrection was the first moment when this divine power of life broke into the fallen reality and gave a formerly mortal human body immortality. Believers have in one sense already died and been raised in him, and in another sense look forward to a fuller participation in that divine reality of life that does not end. Death died in the resurrection because Christ was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely a man, because his return from the grave was not like Lazarus’ a mere rescuscitation but the triumph of divine life over human frailty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being right with God is a complex and multifaceted reality. To understand it, however, one must understand how &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; is just and righteous, because Christian righteousness is &lt;em&gt;Christ’s&lt;/em&gt; righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). God’s righteousness is intrinsic to him; it is expressed in his righteous deeds, most especially in judging justly. His justice, in turn, is expressed in the most gracious and merciful manner imaginable: he punished sin and defeated death in himself, rather than in the people who deserved punishment and had brought death on themselves. Moreover, he also removes the power of sin in their lives so that they ultimately may &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; breaking fellowship with him and each other and may stop acting in such a way as to earn the penalty of sin (death). So God’s justice and righteousness are seen in that he restores people to unbroken relationship with him, removes from them not only their guilt but their brokenness and inevitable tendency toward sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the righteousness that is granted to Christians in Christ, then it is more than (though not less than) a change in judicial state before God. Christians have forensic justification in Christ—they are declared “not guilty” in him—because they are united with him. Colossians 2:9–14 drives home this connection clearly: believers are filled in Christ, buried in death and raised to life with him in baptism. This new life and participation in Christ is then the grounds of God’s setting aside the legal demands that stood against the believer: they are nailed to the cross because Christ was nailed to the cross and the believer &lt;em&gt;is in Christ&lt;/em&gt;. All trespasses are forgiven, because the believer is no longer operating under his own nature but is full of Christ, and in Christ the fullness of God dwells bodily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then to be justified, to be made right with God, is to have all of Christ’s righteousness as &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; one’s own. It is not a legal fiction, but a spiritual reality. The believer is right with God; he may not always live in accord with this reality, but he is. By analogy: a husband is always married to his wife; even if he strays by cheating on her, he remains truly married to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view of justification cuts off at its core any kind of works-righteousness view of righteousness. The righteousness that believers possess is always entirely God’s righteousness mediated to them by the Spirit through their participation in the resurrected Son. It is not, as in the Roman Catholic view, participatory righteousness in which the believer contributes his own righteousness (even if by faith and the Spirit’s power) and the remainder is accomplished by God. Nor is it that God &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to see the believer as if he is righteous when in actuality he is not (yet) righteous because sanctification is incomplete. Rather, no part of the believer’s righteousness—right state, and not only right standing—is his own. Rather, it is always all of God. When acting righteously, one &lt;em&gt;demonstrates&lt;/em&gt; that one is justified, but whoever is in Christ is already truly righteous.&lt;/p&gt;

The Spirit brought about the Incarnation, and raised Jesus from the dead; now the Spirit makes the Son’s work efficacious in the hearts of believers. The Father originated the work of salvation; the Son (in his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension) was and is the means of salvation; the Spirit is the one who guarantees and accomplishes salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, the Spirit opens unbelievers’ eyes to their need for salvation. Sinners apart from the Spirit are lost and hopeless, with either no awareness of need for God (passivity) or an active rejection of God (rebellion). The Spirit opens an unregenerate individual to see his need for salvation, providing an awareness of sinfulness and separation from God, and prompting desire for restored relationship and righteousness. This all happens in the preaching of the gospel, which the Spirit makes effective in the person’s mind—even as the Spirit was responsible for the existence of the gospel in Scripture to begin with. Thus the Spirit inspired the words of the gospel and then brings them to fruition: the Spirit is executor of God’s will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Spirit enables faith in Jesus Christ as the resurrected Son of God, as savior and lord.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In this recognition of one’s need and decisive change in the will—toward rather than away from God—the Spirit brings about the regeneration of the human heart. Regeneration unites the new believer to Jesus Christ: he comes to participate in the Son’s perfected, divinized humanity. Indeed, believers “become partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4). Where once the believer’s heart rejected God, God now appears good and delightful and worthy of worship and trust. Where once one thought nothing of engaging in sin, one now increasingly hates and rejects sin and strives to sin no more. The Spirit replaces a heart of stone with a heart of flesh, and moves believers from darkness to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having accomplished the salvation of an individual soul, the Spirit brings the believer into the community of faith. No person’s salvation is singular or independent. Maturity and completion happen as one participates in the restoration of relationship not only with God but with other human beings. The people of God all participate &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; through the Spirit in Jesus the Son. It is the Spirit who makes the people of God the body of Christ. And the Spirit seals the people of God for redemption, keeping them steadfast in their faith as they build one another up through fellowship and the proclamation of the word and participation in the ordinances—all of which are Spirit-empowered to continue God’s gracious work in the believer’s life, leading ultimately to final salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believers have differed on the particulars of this enabling throughout history, but all affirm that the Spirit does indeed enable faith as a minimum assertion. My own position is that the Spirit does not only &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; faith but &lt;em&gt;supplies&lt;/em&gt; it to hearts which would otherwise reject God. That is, the Spirit is not merely the ultimate ground but also the proximate cause of regeneration.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Those of us who are in Christ are, by the grace of God, slowly being transformed into that &lt;em&gt;something more&lt;/em&gt;. We are being made like God. This is the essential nature of the process of sanctification: slow transformation from our current state into the image of God. Sanctification is one of the most important ideas in the Bible, and many things besides people were sanctified in the course of salvation history. Sanctification is being set apart for service to God, being made “holy” —including especially the various elements used in the pre-Christ sacrificial system. This kind of holiness entails both moral uprightness and distinction from the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first recognize that moral failure is a reality—a sad and tragic reality, but a reality nonetheless—in the life of the Christian. Even after experiencing regeneration and justification, we remain &lt;em&gt;simultus justus et peccator&lt;/em&gt;, to borrow Luther’s famous phrase: simultaneously justified and yet sinners. We remain in the world &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of the world, rather than in it but not of it. We are not yet wholly set apart for God’s works, but too often continue to pursue fallen ends via fallen means. We need to be transformed so that we pursue God’s ends (ultimately: God himself) as he has called us, rather than the things of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God in his wisdom has ordained that we &lt;em&gt;grow&lt;/em&gt; into this. We are justified at a single moment by faith in Christ, and our sanctification will ultimately be finished in a single moment when we are glorified upon our death. In the interval, though, God has called us to pursue him, to strive for the holiness which Christ exemplified for us. As we do, we learn to trust him more and rely more thoroughly on his power and wisdom rather than our own, and this too is part of the process of sanctification. When we are perfected, it will not be a matter of suddenly being able to do on our own what we could not before, but rather that we will finally depend wholly on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this we are growing into the full maturity of humanity. Our model is Jesus Christ: the God-man who shows us what it means to be a perfect human being. He taught us over and over again not only by example but by direct affirmation that his life was characterized above all by dependence on his Father and that he acted not on his own power but that of the Spirit. In our sanctification, we learn to walk the same way. As in our justification, this comes about because we are being united to Christ by the indwelling Spirit—so our growing humanity is also growing to participate in the life of the Trinity. We pursue the Father and his ways, empowered by the Spirit to partake of Christ’s risen, divinized humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of putting it is often jarring to western theologians, but is fully orthodox and has been part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition for sixteen centuries and more. It draws directly on the language of 2 Peter 1:4, which reminds us that we are partakers of the divine nature. It was on that very basis that Peter laid out his enjoinder to grow in the various measures of sanctification: faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love (a list that bears what is surely not a coincidental similarity to Paul’s fruit of the Spirit). Sanctification is our wholehearted pursuit of the things of God, not on our own power but by his gracious work in us, until we someday attain to full maturity and depend wholly on the Spirit’s uniting us to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

The word “justify” and its nominal forms are used to translate words from the &lt;em&gt;dikaoō&lt;/em&gt; (δικαιόω) word group in Greek, which includes a number of related concepts, all circling in various ways around the notion of justice and right action and just and righteous character. Since “justification”—being justified—before God is a central idea in Scripture and an essential element of our salvation, we should be careful to understand what exactly this concept means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most basically, for a person to be justified is for him or her to be righteous, and correspondingly to have acted rightly—in the eyes of God. At a bare minimum, this of course requires both the performance of good works and the rejection of sin. However, justification means more than simply having checked off a series of boxes corresponding to specific good works while having avoided other boxes corresponding to bad or sinful actions. It means being regarded as having done righteously and justly by God, and God sees our hearts, so even doing what is right and shunning what is wrong may not be sufficient: we often have entirely the wrong motives in such actions. We seek the approval of men instead of to please God; we want the social or personal benefits that follow from doing nice things for others; we enjoy stoking the fires of our own pride. In any case, we do not even act rightly, still less do so for the glory of God. So the idea that we might be justified on our own merits is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we should note that ordinary notions of justification often tend to include many of the right (that is, Biblical) concepts of justification in them, but in shallower forms than Scripture supplies. In particular, the use of the term has shifted somewhat from when it was used to translate the word group from Greek into English. When we say, “he was justified,” we do not mean that someone did the right thing, but that whatever someone did, he had grounds for doing. We can of course turn this back to our needs by noting that we have grounds only for right-hearted obedience and none for sinning. Still, this is less than the biblical idea of justification—of being considered to have done rightly in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the “Christian” to be justified, we must be able to stand before God and he consider us righteous in every word and deed and thought and attitude of the heart. This happens in two ways (inseparable from each other): forensic justification and imputed righteousness through union with Christ. In “forensic justification,” God legally acquits us of guilt for committed sin and righteous deeds left undone. The list of offenses we committed was nailed to the cross (cf. Colossians 2:13–15). This can happen because we are united with Jesus the Son of God by the Spirit of God. As Paul notes in 2 Corinthians 5:21, the sinless Christ became sin that we might become the righteousness of God. All that is Christ’s is ours; we are one with him and so we have all his righteousness. (The word “righteousness” here derives from the same root as we translate “justification”—these ideas are inextricably linked.) Finally, God himself justifies us, calling us righteous, because Jesus Christ has both lived in perfect righteousness and paid the penalty for our sins, propitiating the wrath of God (cf. Romans 3).&lt;/p&gt;

Peterson. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1980. 241 pp. $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&lt;/em&gt;, Eugene Peterson advocates for a biblically grounded rather than psychologically-driven approach to pastoral work. He argues that the idea that pastors must first of all be up to date and current has things precisely backwards: the pastor’s responsibility is to lead his congregation back to timeless realities, not into the hippest fads of the day. He suggests that the &lt;em&gt;Megilloth&lt;/em&gt;, the “five scrolls” of Songs of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, have particular lessons to teach pastors as they seek to bring “what is essential in the human condition, not what is accicental” (p. 2) down into the “idiosyncrasies of the local and the personal” (p. 5). A failure either to hold fast to the eternal word and will of God, or to bring it home to those to whom the pastor ministers, will leave the people without what they most deeply need: a shepherd through the vagaries and trials of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson provides a substantial introduction to the book (some ten percent or so of the book’s text), in which he traces out his thesis in detail. He then divides the rest of the book into five discussions of pastoral work, grounding each in one of those “five scrolls.” In each, Peterson interacts with the psychologizing tendency of the present day, the history of the interpretation of the Biblical book in question, and how pastors might learn from and apply the lessons of the book to their own work in their own congregations. For Peterson, Song of Songs is a model for directing God’s people into richer prayer, Ruth is a picture of situating individual stories in the context of salvific history, Lamentations is a guide to walking with people through their suffering, Ecclesiastes is a help in rejecting false religion in place of the fear of God, and Esther is a pointer to the essentially communal nature of the people of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the most significant problem with the book might at first appear to be one of its great strengths. Peteron’s skill as a writer is such that he can sometimes carry the reader along by sheer rhetorical effect—but this is in some sense a result antithetical to the purpose of the text. In a text explicitly and self-consciously aiming to point pastors away from technique and the tendency to mistake emotion for changed lives, the contrast with what Peterson actually does in large swaths of the book is striking and unfortunate. There are too many places where Peterson relies on the emotional impact of his words rather than on the text itself. Nearly the whole chapter on Esther falls into this trap, as do large swaths of the chapters on Ecclesiastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not so much that the points Peterson makes in these chapters are wrong: many of them are quite on target. It is that, disconnected from the text from which he purports to draw them, they become mere floating assertions about the world—assertions that, however beautifully made, we may take or leave as they strike us. There is too much technique in Peterson’s theologizing and too little of the Scripture to which he enjoins his readers to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted that Peterson makes no claim to be writing exegetical commentaries on the text, but he opens the book with the reminder that “we don’t, and we must not, lay our own foundations” (p. 11). Indeed, he (quite rightly) spends the whole introduction pleading for pastors to ground their work not in the trends of the day but in the “eternal will and word of God” (p. 5). It is a strange thing that he should then spend so much of the book on his own ruminations and not wrestling with the particulars of those texts. This is a significant loss, because when Peterson does remain more closely engaged with the text, as in his chapters on Ruth and Lamentations, and as in some parts of his treatment of Ecclesiastes, the effect is marvelous. The reader is drawn into wonder at the way God’s word guides us effectively for pastoral ministry. The pastor is reminded that the circumstances and trials he and his flock face are not things newly sprung up in the late twentieth or early twenty-first century, but the sorts of things for which God has already supplied guides and instruction in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is no surprise: this is Peterson’s own thesis. The power of our faith, the fruitfulness of pastoral ministry (and the effectiveness of our books thereon) is not in our technique but in grappling deeply with the word of God in our own situations. The more he grapples with the Scriptures, the more his technique serves the text, the better Peterson’s book is—and vice versa. Where technique serves exposition, the reader is built up. Where exposition falls aside and rhetoric reigns, the reader may be moved emotionally, but little remains when that glow fades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, for four of the five chapters in the book, Peterson’s success in advancing his thesis may largely be measured by the extent to which he engages the text. In Ruth and Lamentations, the narrative and poetry respectively drive the discussion, and so the chapters are profoundly helpful. The discussion of Ruth helps the pastor see his peoples’ personal stories rightly—and thus, to help his people see their own stories rightly. They are not the end-all and be-all that modern psychology might make them out to be, but neither are they insignificant. Indeed, they are all the more significant precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are part of something much bigger than themselves. The discussion of Lamentations helps a pastor to see the necessity both of walking &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; suffering and sorrow with his flock and of helping them come to resolution in the right time. Petersons’ treatment of Ecclesiastes, as a guide to saying &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; to false religion, seems to be an accurate analysis of the book, but Peterson veers away from the Text. He deals too little with the specific ways in which &lt;em&gt;Qoheleth&lt;/em&gt; confronts our culture and too much in the sweeping generalizations about the value of those confrontations. Least helpful of all is his treatment of Esther, in which he rightly diagnoses severe problems in the culture around us but leaves aside almost everything in the book itself. We desperately need the kind of rebuke to individualism he suggests here. Whether Esther can support that kind of rebuke, still less offer an alternative vision of the people of God, is left aside in favor of a good but largely-unrelated discussion of Saul and Amalek and the shape of ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson’s treatment of the Song of Songs deserves its own analysis. The text is notoriously hard to interpret, and has been subject to countless different readings. Peterson falls squarely into the allegorical camp, though he gives the allegorical reading something of a twist. The urgency of romantic (both emotional and sexual) desire so prominent in the book he transmutes into a picture of the Christian’s right desire for communion with God. This was the chapter in which Peterson hewed &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; closely to the text, and so it was the chapter least susceptible to the problems outlined above. As with all treatments of the Song, though, the effectiveness of the chapter hinges on whether one finds Peterson’s interpretation accurate. (I did not.) Insofar as one grants Peterson’s interpretation, though, the chapter is an effective argument for the necessity of prayer, and especially of the pastor leading his people to pray with greater fervency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&lt;/em&gt; is in some ways a very good book, but in others it falls short—an especially unfortunate reality given the very real problems at which it aimed. That Peterson wants to see pastors grounding their &lt;em&gt;pastoring&lt;/em&gt; in the Scriptures as well as their preaching and teaching is clear. Less clear is whether this book will be as effective as it could have been in accomplishing that end. Good pastoral work does not run aground only on the rocks of psychology. Rhetoric is an equally deadly reef, and it may be the more tempting to a skilled writer passionate for the recovery of Biblical pastoral work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters on Ruth and Lamentations were excellent and profoundly helpful treatments of the topics they addressed, and Peterson’s treatment of Song of Songs was at least interesting. Because he exchanged exposition for effect in his treatments of Ecclesiastes and Esther, though, the book falters. Though his words never failed to pack an emotional punch, they were too often hollowed out by their lack of a connection to the text. In this, these chapters serve as an accidental and unfortunate illustration of the necessity of Peterson’s own thesis. We need not more effective psychology, nor more powerful lnaguage, but a deeper reliance on and connection to the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Though these gifts are certainly part of the recorded history of the Spirit’s work, the church’s focus thereupon (whether positive or negative) on the gifts has had the unfortunate side effect of hiding many of the other, arguably more central and essential actions of the Spirit in the life of the believer. Just as the Spirit is the person who mediates to us the work of Christ in our salvation and brings about our conversion, the Spirit is the one who leads us into greater participation in the renewed humanity the Son has accomplished in his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. The Spirit is the one who progressively deepens our union with Christ and reshapes us to be like Him who saved us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spirit accomplishes these ends in a variety of ways, all of which are themselves worthy of further reflection. First of all, it was the Spirit who superintended the writing of Scripture, the self-revelation of the Triune Godhead for our salvation and sanctification. If Christian formation is in no small measure a matter of growing to know our Creator—if we are being restored to active relationship with one who made us for that very relationship—then the ways in which our Creator has revealed himself are supremely important. Without Scripture, we would know little of God; through it we enter in the deep mysteries. The first part the Spirit plays in our formation, then, is in having guided every hand from Moses’ to John’s in the writing of the word of God. Upon this foundation comes the Spirit’s second work: opening our eyes to understand that Scripture. The things of God are foolishness to unregenerate people, but beautiful and savory to those who have been given spiritual life. The word of God can seem dense and opaque to those who do not believe, but every believer in Christ finds that more and more these mysteries unfold: this is the Spirit at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we come to understand the person of God and the things he has commanded us in his word, we find that we are still weak and struggle to do them. Here, too, the Spirit is at work, for it is the Spirit who empowers our obedience. We know that the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead is at work in us—and this is the only hope we have of overcoming sin and growing in holiness. Part and parcel of this, the Spirit empowers us to endure the suffering that God uses to make us more dependent on him and more faithful to him. Likewise, when in the course of our lives we are tempted to fall away, it is the Spirit who helps us continue to hold fast to the faith. Moreover, the Spirit intercedes for us when we do not know how to pray ourselves. When we are beset by temptation, when tempted to fall away, when exhausted from the battle, when wearied of the pursuit of holiness, the Spirit prays for us. Nor is the Spirit’s work directed solely to individuals. All of these realities are corporate, and in all of them we grow in unity and kindness toward one another. The Spirit is our bond of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, then, we have both the Spirit and the Son praying for us to the Father who delights to answer those prayers, and the Spirit empowering us walk in the Son’s life with the Father—hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS]</category></item><item><title>The Spirit and Conversion</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-spirit-and-conversion.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Holy Spirit is the member of the Triune Godhead who actively brings about our conversion. It is the Spirit who regenerates a person, indwells him, and seals him for the day of salvation. The spirit makes the gospel powerfully effective for salvation so that those who hear it may believe and be saved. On these points all are agreed, since they are backed by straightforward statements in Scripture. The particulars, however, are a matter of some controversy, and so bear further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two broad views of the Spirit’s work in regeneration. In the non- Calvinist view (whether Arminian, Roman Catholic, or variations thereon in other streams of Christian tradition), the Spirit does preparatory work in the hearts of the unregenerate and provides God’s grace to enable people to choose whether to respond to the gospel or not. However it is articulated (most commonly as “prevenient grace” in Baptist circles), this view emphasizes that the Spirit’s work is essential in making available the effects of Christ’s work on the cross to whomever will believe. Without the Spirit’s work, regeneration through faith is impossible, because no one will believe. With the Spirit’s work, men are enabled to choose freely whether to follow God or no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Calvinist view, by contrast, the Spirit not only works in a preparatory sense, but is also the active agent in bringing about conversion. People choose as they will, and people dead in their trespasses always choose sin over God—this is the essence of our fallen nature. What is needed, in this view, is not only the grace-given ability to choose (as in a prevenient grace view) but a grace-changed heart so that we will freely choose God. No matter how free our choice, unless the effects of original sin in us are undone, we continue freely to choose sin and to reject God. The Spirit, then, takes away hearts of stone and gives instead beating hearts of flesh that can respond to God. He gives eyes to see the light he shines as well as the light itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential disagreement between the two views is to whom the Spirit gives such eyes: to all men who hear the gospel, or only to the elect. Based on Paul’s arguments in 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and elsewhere, I take it to be the latter. If the Spirit opened everyone’s eyes to see truly the goodness of God, if he gave to everyone hearts of flesh rather than hearts of stone all would believe. Regeneration logically precedes (but temporally coincides with) faith: the unregenerate heart cannot and does not believe. So the Spirit gives hearts that can and do believe, and in that very moment, we believe. The Spirit gives us not only the opportunity to exercise faith, but also the faith that we exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the act of regeneration is accomplished, the Spirit is efficaciously at work. In both views, the gospel &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; powerful for salvation—whether by tilling the soil or by actually causing the seed to sprout. People hear the gospel and the Spirit uses that mightily. Then, once people have believed, the Holy Spirit continues to work. He immediately indwells the believer, giving our mortal bodies spiritual vitality. Thus Paul says that the same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead is now at work in all believers. This indwelling seals our conversion, ensuring we hold fast until we die or Christ returns. He increasingly shapes our behaviors and attitudes to be more in line with those of God, making us holy as God is holy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Spirit is the one who makes Christ’s work effective for salvation. He enables and empowers the gospel to produce conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS</category></item><item><title>The Resurrection is Essential</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-resurrection-is-essential.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Paul tells us that if Jesus was not raised from the dead, then we are still dead in our trespasses (1 Corinthians 15:17). This simple statement uncovers a great deal about the necessity of Christ’s resurrection as well as his death on our behalf, as does much of the rest of the New Testament’s view of the resurrection. Paul tells us, for example, that Christ died for our trespasses and was raised for our justification (Romans 4:25). Likewise, he notes Jesus’ resurrection from the dead is intrinsically linked to our own life (e.g. Romans 8:11). Moreover, we know that if Jesus was not raised from the dead, then neither will we be (1 Corinthians 15:16). We know that it was in the resurrection that Jesus was shown to be the Son of God in power (Romans 1:4) and thus the one who reigns over all things. Moreover, we note that the preaching of the apostles as recorded in Acts refers to the resurrection of Christ as the evidence that he is indeed the Jewish messiah and the judge of the earth— indeed, from Acts we see that the apostolic message &lt;em&gt;centered&lt;/em&gt; on the resurrection of Christ. Likewise, the very shape of the gospels is such that each in its own way climaxes not with Jesus’ death but with his resurrection, as if to say that the central issue of our faith is not the death of Christ but his being raised from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we put together all these pieces, it becomes clear that the resurrection is integral in our salvation. It is not merely the “seal” upon the work Jesus did at the cross, the evidence that the cross accomplished what it needed to. It is part and parcel of our salvation, in and of itself. It is true that the resurrection does indeed ratify the elements of the saving work of Christ that were accomplished on the cross, but this is not all that it does. It seems clear from the evidence of the New Testament that the resurrection itself is efficacious in saving us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our mortal bodies are corrupted by sin, as we know they are, and if the penalty of sin is death, as we know it is, then something more than payment for sin must happen. Payment for sin is necessary, and so Jesus’ substitutionary atonement in death on the cross is essential to our salvation. However, there is more that is essential to our salvation. Reconciliation between God and man began in the Incarnation, as in Jesus the Son of God united humanity and deity in perfect fellowship once again, and it was accomplished (though not yet finished) in the resurrection as Jesus took up a restored body in which the power of sin and death were finally broken: an image of what our bodies will be in the age to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we know that if we die as things were before the Resurrection, even were our sins paid for, we remain mortal and would never rise again of our own merits. In his resurrection, Jesus triumphed over death—the last enemy—and we know that the same Spirit that raised him from the dead will raise us from the dead. We know that Jesus’ resurrection is the means of our justification. He paid for our sins in his atoning death, but he sets us right with God in his triumphant new life. We know that his reign as the rightful heir of all things was inaugurated in his resurrection, not in his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, essential as was his death for our salvation, the resurrection of Christ is no less important in our being restored to life with God.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>SEBTS]</category></item><item><title>The Servant of God</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2014/the-servant-of-god.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Servant pictured in Isaiah is one of the most famous images in the Old Testament for Christians. The language applied to him in Isaiah 53 in particular has long been understood by Christians to point directly to Jesus as the atoning savior. The role of the Servant in the book is somewhat more complex than a simple prediction of Jesus as subtitutionary atonement however: it encompasses that idea, but does much more as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The label of Servant is applied to two (or possibly three) different roles in Isaiah: the nation of Israel, and one who suffers and works on behalf of Israel. This latter role certainly contains messianic overtures, but may also include poetic references to Isaiah’s own suffering on behalf Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the Servant first appears in chapter 40, and is immediately and directly applied in reference to Israel/Jacob. The same is true of its appearance in chapters 41 and 43, though the language used of the servant in chapter 42 suggests an individual and not the nation, and should perhaps be taken as pointing to a king who represents the nation given the national context. Beginning in chapter 45 and moving forward, the Servant increasingly appears as the individual who acts for Israel on Yahweh’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the Servant-Israel or the Servant-for-Israel (as we might label them), the Servant exists to be God’s agent in bringing about the obedience of the nations. The Servant-Israel experiences cleansing and purification to that end, while the Servant-for-Israel experiences suffering in place of Israel, for her sins and to save her from her unrighteous ways.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In both cases, the suffering is part of God’s plan to lead the nations out of their idolatry to participate in his covenant with Israel. The shape of the role taken by the Servant differs, though, and as the book progresses the need for the Servant-for-Israel becomes more and more clear, because the Servant-Israel is simply not up to the task (as was made clear by the first 39 chapters of the book!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Servant-for-Israel acts on behalf of Israel in the latter parts of chapters 40–55. He picks up kingly responsibilities of doing justice and righteousness in the earth (a theme Isaiah seems to take up from the Psalms and elaborate). He stands as Israel’s representative in dealing with her sin. He brings the nations in to participate in Israel’s covenant life with God. In some sense, the messianic king figure becomes True Israel on Israel’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition between Servant-Israel and Servant-for-Israel not only picks up messianic overtones, but also hints at autobiographical elements for Isaiah himself. Lest Christian readers be skittish at this notion, wanting to preserve the text’s unique way of pointing to Jesus: it is hardly uncommon for figures in the Old Testament to prefigure the messiah in various ways. Here it is Jesus’ role as Prophet we see prefigured, just asthe entire Levitical system prefigured him as Priest and David prefigured him as King. Isaiah’s suffering on behalf of Israel is a clear parallel to Jesus’ ministry, and Jesus himself makes this clear in his teaching in the New Testament, where he emphasizes that he came in part to close eyes and ears as well as open them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the progression is that the reader moves from seeing Israel as God’s servant to recognizing the need for a servant who will work as God’s agent on Israel’s behalf, to seeing that even Isaiah was an incomplete picture of this servant. The one of whom Isaiah prophesied would be not only Prophet but also king and both priest and sacrifice on behalf of the people. He would not only speak of the nations coming to participate in fellowship with God in the Zion of Israel, he would bring it about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the redemption pictured in Isaiah goes beyond subtitution for sins, and includes restoration to a holy nature—a theme that is picked up clearly in the New Testament but too often overlooked by modern readers.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

After a short introductory statement, the book moves into a series of extended metaphors for wisdom and folly to illustrate the point. These metaphors are those of the two women, the two houses, and the two ways—with the choices between the two illustrated in each case by the simple youth who may choose one or the other and become either wise or a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two women of the book are the Ladies Wisdom and Folly. Throughout the first nine chapters, the two stand in opposition to each other everywhere. Wisdom calls out on the streets, by the gates, and in the highest point of the city. She represents the first aspect of God’s order in the world, that foundational principle on which the world is built. She is an attribute of the creation God made and a reflection of his desires and character. By contrast, the adulteress (or “foreign woman”) who leads astray a simple youth and destroys him in chapter 7 is a picture not only of the particular follies of adultery but a personification of all that is foolish: wherever wisdom stands and calls out, so too does the adulteress—Lady Folly in one of her most deceptive forms. She is an image of what it means to go against the grain of God’s created order, and the consequence of going with her is death. No surprise, that: going against the structure of God’s reality has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; led to death, beginning in Genesis 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ways and two houses pick up this same motif and trace it out further. One way leads to life, the other to death. One house is steadfast and sure, while the other crumbles. One belongs to Wisdom, the other to Folly. These images Jesus picks up again in his own teaaching in the New Testament: The way that leads to life is narrow, and few find it, but the way that leads to destruction is wide and many walk it. The wise man builds his house on the rock that is Jesus’ word, but the foolish man builds his house on the sand that is worldly wisdom. The naïve youth may answer Lady Wisdom’s invitation and follow her along the way of wisdom to the house of wisdom and so become wise, or he may answer Lady Folly’s call, walk down folly’s road to the house of destruction and so become a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the “wise person” and the “fool” then come up time and again throughout the rest of the book. Whatever one decides has the enormous consequences that the book traces out: fools become insolent, ignorant, murderous rebels against God, while wise people become gracious, temperate, gentle followers of God.&lt;/p&gt;

This reading has a number of difficulties, not least in that though the characters in the book raise this question, neither God in his appearance nor the narrator offer an answer to it. Indeed, the final shape of the book is such that the reader has some understanding of why &lt;em&gt;Job&lt;/em&gt; suffered as he did—but only some. God’s reasons for acting in the particular ways he did remain hidden, and (more importantly) the answers we see in Job’s specific case are clearly not applicable to every case of human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible way out of this problem is to approach the text from a different angle. Supposing that Job was not written as a theodicy, but as an exploration of an entirely different need, how might we read the book more profitably? One suggestion is that the central issue in the text is how Job might move from a position of ritual mourning back into a position of ritual life—and this approach does indeed yield significant exegetical fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Job’s troubles experienced in the first two chapters of the book warranted his entering a state of ritual mourning: he experienced calamity in the loss of his possessions, the death of his sons and daughters, and the onset of a skin disease. The Levitical law proscribed the kinds of mourning an Israelite would undergo under each of these circumstances, and none were trivial. Though Job as a non-Israelite would not have lived under the Levitical law, he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; live in a culture that embraced that pattern of ritual mourning in response to these problems, and the Israelite audience would have recognized his behavior as such. Thus, in Job 1–2, we see Job respond to his great calamity by tearing his clothes, going out of the town and sitting on the trash heap, and scraping his skin with a shard of pottery. These were not merely expressions of his grief (though, to be sure, he was grieved) but symbolic statements that he had entered a state of ritual death in a period of mourning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job now needed a way to move back to ritual life, the ordinary state of affairs. Culturally, “comforters” were the means afforded him for this end, and this explains the efforts of Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and (eventually) Elihu. Each in his way sought to help Job come to terms with his loss, become right with God, and return to ordinary life. Since the three each embraced both the so-called “retribution principle” and its corollary—that God rewards the righteous and punishes the wicked, and that accordingly prosperity and suffering are indicators of righteousness and wickedness respectively—they all tried to convince Job that he ought to repent of his apparent sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, none could persuade Job of any sin warranting such suffering as he endured, and moreover the book agrees with Job: the narrative prologue first chapters tells us that Job was “blameless and upright” and that “in all this [his initial response to loss] he did not sin.” Job’s bitter response midway through the book (“Miserable comforters are you all!”) makes perfect sense in this context: they were not relieving him of his state of ritual death, for their words offered no way forward. Thus, Job increasingly turns away from answering his friends to pleading with God to appear and answer him, though as Job acknowledges, no one can contend with God. Still: even against the largely accurate answers Elihu provides in chapters 32–36, Job was unmoved. He needed something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God appears, he does not answer Job’s questions, but neither does he accuse him of sin. Rather, he shows Job his wisdom, and how greatly his wisdom exceeds Job’s understanding. This, it seems, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what Job needed in order to move from mourning back to life. He is able to say, “Before, I had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you,” and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is what triggers his return to normal life at the end of the book. Moreover, his statement of repentance in Job 42 makes a great deal more sense this way: he now turned away (“repented” in the bare sense) &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; dust and ashes—not repenting of some unnamed sin &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; dust and ashes. Indeed, this (the common reading) would hardly make sense, given that Job immediately puts off his dust and ashes and returns to his life. Job was able to move from ritual death to ritual life because he had encountered God. As a result, Job did return to all the ordinary parts of life. Whereas the mourner was forbidden from feasting, worshipping, and sexual activity, Job participates in all three in the conclusion of the book. His friends and family come and eat with him. He offers sacrifice for his friends. He fathers more children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, taking Job in light of ancient near eastern mourning ritual helps us understand the book’s message and structure far more clearly than taking it as a theodicy. The text does not seek to answer why God allows evil. Indeed, it inverts the question: who are we to think we could understand? In Job we have instead a recognition that the only thing that will really satisfy the soul of one experiencing the deep suffering that life brings is an encounter with the living God. The only thing that could move Job from ritual death to ritual life is the only thing that can move us from spiritual death to spiritual life—not mere academic knowledge of facts about God, but encountering him as one who may be known.&lt;/p&gt;

Nearly every major heresy the church confronts (and no few of its littler skirmishes) revolve around issues of the nature of the Incarnate Son of God. From the earliest days of the church, there has been a tension between those emphasizing Jesus’ humanity at the cost of his deity and those emphasizing his deity at the cost of his humanity. The clear testimony of Scripture, however, is that Jesus was everything that it is to be God and also everything that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say, then, that in the Incarnation the Son of God ‘took his flesh from Mary’, we are emphasizing that he inherited from her all that it means to be a human being. Nothing was missing or absent. The Word who was from the beginning, and through whom the Father created the world, and indeed for whom the world exists, took upon himself human body and soul/mind/spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He participated fully in all the weaknesses of human existence. He became subject to common colds and the need to expel waste from his body. He experienced teething pains, and he needed to eat and sleep. He experienced real temptation to sin, more fully than has any other human because he resisted it to the last. He bore the sorrows of life in a world filled with suffering and war and death. He was in everything the word means &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. As the author of Hebrews puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. (Hebrews 2:14–18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share in flesh and blood; he shared in flesh and blood. He became like us in every respect—not partially, not in some respects, but in every respect. He suffered when he was tempted; the lures and draws of the world did not simply pass by him without any challenge whatsoever. He took from Mary &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because, as the Fathers pointed out, what he has not assumed has not been redeemed. Redemption is more than (though of course not less than) propitiation for sins. It is the re-uniting of humanity with God, so that all the myriad ways in which human nature has been broken may be set once again how it ought to be. It is the restoration of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the things that were broken in humanity by the Fall. There is no part of humanity that was not broken by the Fall, no part that does not need restoration, no part that was not cut off from fellowship with God. Thus, there is no part of humanity that is not in need of redemption, and so anything the Son did not take up of our humanity when he became Jesus the Christ is still broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jesus had only the mind of God and not a human mind, then our minds are still unredeemed. If Jesus’ body was not the Son’s body but a drone-like extension of his will, then our minds remain unredeemed. If Jesus’ will was not a human will but purely and only a divine will, then our wills remain unredeemed. In each case, if Jesus was not both God and man in his nature, we are lost. In this sense, then, few things are of more theological import than the nature of the incarnation. The cross and resurrection, powerful though they are, do not have their intended effect of redeeming lost women and men unless the Incarnation was the complete joining of God and man in Jesus. And so: praise be to God! For when Jesus took his flesh from Mary, he took up humanity whole and entire, leaving nothing out, and joined it with his deity whole and entire, leaving nothing out. So now we through him participated in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), just as he participated in human nature.&lt;/p&gt;

The central passage is Romans 5:12–14:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic historic, orthodox&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; views of this position may be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are guilty of Adam’s sin because they were in his loins when he sinned, and so have not only been contaminated with his sinful nature but also actively sinned when he sinned, and so are guilty and under judgment of death from their very conception—a position most famously and forcefully articulated by Augustine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born guilty of Adam’s sin because he acted as the federal head of the human race and so we are imputed guilty in him, just as when we partipate in the humanity of the new federal head of humanity—Jesus Christ—his righteousness is imputed to us. In this view, humans are born subject to the punishment of sin (including death) because all of us are &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; guilty in Adam, just as we experience the blessings of holiness when in Christ because we are &lt;em&gt;counted&lt;/em&gt; righteous in him (the historic Reformed view).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All humans are born innocent of Adam’s guilt, but by dint of descent from him have the same corrupted sinful nature he did, and therefore all &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; sin and incur guilt before a holy God. Furthermore, as Adam’s descendants, all are born separated from God and therefore mortal. In this view, humans are born innocent of guilt but inevitably sin because of their fallen humanity and die because of their separation from God. This is the view articulated by the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic logic of the passage seems to run most closely in line with this last articulation. Paul argues that “sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned”. While Augustine and the Reformers both took this latter phrase to mean “all sinned &lt;em&gt;in Adam&lt;/em&gt;” it must be recognized that the idea that all sinned “in Adam” is foreign to the text. Indeed, the sentence that follows immediately on the heels of this first declaration suggest that it is individuals’ sins committed in their own lives, and not Adam’s sin, that is in view here. Otherwise, the distinction between the sins that some committed before the law came and the sins that others committed after the law came makes little sense. So likewise does the distinction between Adam’s sin and that of those who followed him, even those whose sin was not like his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant textual challenge to this understanding comes in Paul’s statement that “death spread to all men because all sinned”—a statement that is hard to reconcile with the notion of the lack of conscious sin in infants or the mentally handicapped. Certainly many humans die in infancy, and indeed many die &lt;em&gt;in utero&lt;/em&gt; long before the cognitive ability to make any choice whatsoever has developed. Thus, there is at least some sense in which Paul’s argument entails the death of human beings who have not yet come under condemnation for their own sin because of Adam’s sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the views outlined above resolve this tension perfectly. The Augustinian view seems overly bound up in Augustine’s views on sexual intercourse as the means of the transmission of sin to human nature. The federal headship view places more emphasis on the idea of imputation than this passage seems to support, but deals forthrightly with the issue of death in the lives of those who have committed no sins. The idea that humans are born innocent of specific guilt but subject to a sin nature that leads inevitably to sin seems to do justice to the basic flow of Paul’s argument, but struggles with the application of death to those who have not sinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating the latter two options seems the best solution. People die because Adam corrupted human nature, and all participate in his corrupted human nature—a nature separated from the fellowship with God essential to human immortality—unless united to a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; human nature. People are guilty for their own sins, not for Adam’s, but they die because they share Adam’s basic nature, which came out of his guilt. In due time, they themselves sin they &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; the death in which they already shared by dint of their broken humanity. Even this solution, it must be admitted, remains somewhat messier than we might like, but it is to be preferred as best dealing with all the evidence before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leave aside non-orthodox positions such as the Pelagian view that people are born able to live perfectly righteous lives, with uncorrupted natures, which runs against the clear teaching of Scripture that all sin and moreover that all &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; sin because of the fallenness of our humanity.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament has several terms its authors often use to describe the broad concept of sin:&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘avah&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “bent” or “crooked”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘aval&lt;/em&gt;, which includes the idea of a lack of integrity, so is often given as “iniquity”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘avar&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to cross over” or “transgress”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ra‘&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “the rule of evil”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ma‘al&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “breach of trust”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;pasha‘&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to revolt” or “refuse subjection to a rightful authority”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these we see that humanity’s brokenness before God in the Old Testament was often conceived of in terms of doing things the wrong way, or in rejection of the rightful authority, or a mix of the two. Rebellion against the creator and his created order are essential ingredients of the concept of sin for the Old Testament authors. To do evil is to be in rebellion against the right way God established for things to be done, to reject his &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; and replace it with destruction and disharmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common term for sin in the Old Testament, however, and the one usually translated into the English “sin” is &lt;em&gt;chatha&lt;/em&gt;, meaning “to miss the mark”. Sinning was thus not necessarily always a matter of active, willful rejection of God. It was also simply failing, by dint of corrupted human nature, to do as God called humanity to do, in any and all spheres of life. Sin was thus a pervasive and corrupting influence on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of human existence, not only on those who were consciously rebelling against God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the New Testament picks up on many of these same ideas. Though the specific terms used have different semantic ranges than those in the Old Testament, as a group they cover much of the same territory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parabasis&lt;/em&gt;, “the transgression of a boundary”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;parakoe&lt;/em&gt;, “disobedience to a voice”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;paraptoma&lt;/em&gt;, “falling where one should have stood upright”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;agnoema&lt;/em&gt;, “failing to know what one should have known”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;hettema&lt;/em&gt;, “diminishing what should have been fully rendered”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;anomia&lt;/em&gt;, failing to observe a law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;plemmeleia&lt;/em&gt;, “a discord in the harmonies of God’s universe”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Old Testament range, they add this final notion of discord in the created order—a concept that was present in the Old Testament, to be sure, in the notion of lost &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt;, but which was not so directly expressed. Again, as in the Old Testament, these emphasize both failure to do and active rejection of what is right. And, as in the Old Testament, the New Testament authors’ concept of sin is most commonly expressed in a single word meaning “missing the mark”: &lt;em&gt;hamartia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This congruence between the Old and New Testament views of sin emphasizes the fundamental unity between the various authors’ understanding of the issues at stake. Sin is everything about humanity’s failure to follow God’s ways and live in accord with his design for the universe. It encompasses the whole range of human foibles, from accidental failure and ignorance to the kind of rebellion that shakes its fist at the heavens or boldly (and foolishly) proclaims that there is no God. Sin is getting it wrong—or, to put it another way that better captures the breadth of Scriptural language on the issue, not getting it &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; right, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

If he ate from that tree, however, he would die the very day he ate of it (Genesis 2:17). When, in Genesis 3, Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, they did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; die—at least, not physically. Indeed, Adam lived to be over nine hundred years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, did God mean when he told Adam that he would sure die the very day he ate of the tree? Did he lie, or make a mistake, or change his mind after the fact? Plainly put, no: none of these are true. Rather, all of them mistake the nature of the death entailed in God’s word to Adam. The death Adam immediately experienced was not physical death but spiritual death. Physical death was a consequence—a symptom, as it were—of his spiritual death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spiritual death was multifold, and we see the various elements of it traced out in the explanation of the fall given in Genesis 3. First of all came separation from God. Rather than being in right relationship with the creator, Adam now needed restoration. Whereas he had enjoyed fellowship and relationship with his maker, now Adam experienced fear at the thought of encountering him, so that he hid himself when God came walking in the garden in the cool of the day. The rest of the Old Testament traces this theme out in great detail; it is constantly asking the question, “How may these unrighteous people come before a holy God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, God removed Adam from the means of grace he had supplied to sustain his mortal body. He had provided a tree of life from which Adam could eat so that his body would go on living without fail. After the fall, Adam was removed from this supply, and so his body began to fall apart. He began to experience the first phase of physical death: aging and decay. He no longer had access to the supernatural sustenance he required not to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, he immediately experienced relational brokenness. The previously holy and mutually delightful relationship he had experienced with his wife would now be characterized by mutual blame and recriminations. Likewise, his sons would not be loving brothers: one would kill the other. No more would he live in a world characterized by peace and harmony, but one shaped by conflict and war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of these, though, it was the first that was most important and deepest. Adam’s separation from God was at the root of all the other problems he now faced. It was the lack of God’s spirit in him that led to his physical death. It was the lack of God’s presence in their midst, and the brokenness of his image in them, that led men and women to be in conflict rather than mutually supporting one another. With this separation came a warp in the character of humanity that comprised the final part of Adam’s immediate death: no more would his will be ready to obey God. Instead, he (and all his descendants) would be quick to turn aside to go against the grain of God’s universe. Given the opportunity, all would sin, and no one would turn away from sin without God’s intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Adam &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; experience death the very day, indeed the very moment, that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The death was more profound and more horrifying than physical death alone would have been, though, because it was a death that stretched to every point of his life, from his family and the tasks with which God had entrusted him, to his very connection with God. Everything became broken in him, and he no longer knew God. In gaining the knowledge of good and evil, he lost the knowledge of the one of whom knowledge matters most.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether Jesus Christ’s death provided substition for the sins of all people or just some has been the cause of many dissensions and denominational splits in the Protestant world ever since the Reformation. Most famously, Arminius and his followers were expelled from the Calvinistic churches over this very issue and the way they worked out their stance in other areas of doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, what is at issue is not whether Jesus’ death was of sufficient merit to save all people. Jesus the incarnate Son of God provided a sacrifice of infinite worth, undoubtedly of sufficient worth to cover all the sins of all mankind in all of history. Rather, the question is to whom the atonement is applied and how—or, to put it differently, to whom its benefits are available. Thus, the phrases of “limited atonement” and “unlimited atonement” are best understood as referring to the availability and effect of the atonement, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it must be recognized that all orthodox Christians affirm that the effects of the atonement are limited in at least one important sense: not all people are redeemed, and therefore not all people benefit from the atonement of Christ. To put it as many have before, all orthodox believers affirm that the atonement was “sufficient for all, but efficient for some,” for if it was “efficient” for all, then all would be saved. (To affirm any lesser effect is to diminish the atonement. This is not to say that there may not be other, broader effects of Christ’s death on the cross—e.g. the notion of prevenient grace enabling all to respond to the preached word—only that the atonement itself is not applied universally.) The question then is only who those “some” are and the terms under which the atonement is available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest answer is simply to say, “the elect!” and have done, leaving aside the tendentious question of who is elect—but this question is precisely where the rubber meets the road on the issue of the atonement. After all, everyone agrees that the only the sins of those who believe are actually removed in Christ, regardless of how election works out. Thus, when people speak of “limited” or “unlimited” atonement, they are usually speaking of the issue of general or specific election. Does the work of Christ mean that all are equally able to hear and respond to the gospel, or does it mean that only the elect are enabled to hear and respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most faithful articulation of the matter is to speak of the atonement in three ways. First, we affirm that Jesus’ death was sufficient to atone for the sins of the world—&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the world. Second, we offer the atonement freely to everyone. Although the only the elect will be saved (however we understand that to play out), the Scriptures clearly enjoin us to proclaim Christ’s subtitutionary death and justifying resurrection to sinners everywhere and to urge everyone to repent and trust in him. Third, we affirm that the saving work of the atonement is applied to the sins of those who confess Christ as Savior and Lord and obey him. We need not perfectly understand or agree upon the means by which people come to confess Christ as Lord to affirm that it is only in that affirmation and obedience that one’s sins are covered in the atonement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus most appropriate to speak of Jesus’ atonement as unlimited in extent but limited in effect.&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, we affirm that he was fully human, and this affirmation binds us to affirm that he could indeed sin: all humans are capable of sinning, and apart from Jesus, all humans &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; sinned. The author of Hebrews reminds us forcefully that Jesus was made like his brothers—which is to say, &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;—in every respect, being tempted like them, yet without sin. On the other hand, we recognize that the Godhead is sinless and that, as James reminds us, he neither tempts nor can be tempted with evil. As with many issues relating to the Incarnation, we face the challenge of holding together both Jesus’ full deity and his full humanity. When either is lost (or even simply diminished) in order to emphasize or preserve the other, important aspects of our faith break in serious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult (mysterious even) the question may be, but the author of Hebrews leaves little doubt. Jesus was tempted like us in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; way—not only in some ways, but in every way. This is an essential affirmation for the Christian faith. If Jesus could not sin, then he was not fully human, and his perfect life is unsurprising and not particularly meaningful. If he &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sin, then his perfect life is extraordinary and especially meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must integrate the things that Hebrews and James (and the rest of the Scriptures) teach us. If the Godhead cannot be tempted by sin and Jesus &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; tempted by sin, does this make Jesus somehow &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; God? No, for this misses the rest of the witness of the New Testament, including those selfsame books. James himself calls Jesus Lord in terms that, set against a Jewish background, can only be understood to refer to God himself (see especially James 5:11, perhaps the most direct quote of Exodus 34:6 in the whole New Testament and an unmistakable reference to Yahweh God). Neither can we admit the notion that James and Hebrews disagree with each other—at least, not and maintain our affirmation of the unity of Scripture, which is a non-negotiable from where I stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many things in the Trinity and the Incarnation, then, we are left making a dual (and apparently conflicting affirmation). Jesus’ humanity was perfectly capable of sinning, and his divinity was incapable of sinning. The Incarnation holds the two together in a single person, and so we affirm that Jesus could have sinned, but did not. We note, too, that he did not precisely because he did as all humans are called to do (and what glorified humans &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do) and perfectly trusted the Father by obeying the Holy Spirit. Jesus’ perfect life was not the domination of his humanity by his divinity, but the submission of his humanity to the divinity of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we affirm that Jesus’ not sinning on our behalf was a real moral victory, not a hollow thing we can only look at bemusedly from afar. He lived as a real second Adam, doing what the first Adam failed to do while beset by many more and far greater temptations than the first Adam. He really did overcome the world— not only its powers, but its temptations. He really did demonstrate true and perfect holiness that we might follow his example. He really did triumph over every power of sin, that we might be transformed into his likeness. Though the triune God is never tempted to sin, the triune God mysteriously partook of everything it is to be human in the Incarnation, and that humanity &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be tempted—and he overcame.&lt;/p&gt;

The historic, orthodox answer is a resounding “yes”—though a clearly qualified and well articulated “yes.” This is not just the historic, orthodox position; it is the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; position. Mary was indeed the “mother of God”. She was the mother of Jesus. Jesus was (and is) fully God &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fully man, completely and truly, both at once without loss of the full measure of either. He did not cease being totally divine upon his incarnation, but he did assume full humanity. The argument is as simple as it first seems: Mary is the mother of Jesus, and Jesus is God, therefore Mary is the mother of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evangelicals tend to shy away from following the broader tradition and affirming that Mary is the mother of God. There are many reasons for this, not least our general discomfort with things having to do with Mary born of the over- referencing of Mary in the Catholic tradition and the actual Mariolatry that is too often evinced in Catholic lay practice throughout the world. However, our response ought not be to reject this view, but to speak carefully and clearly and reject what is mistaken while keeping what is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that we must be nuanced in our handling of this issue. The word “mother” brings with it implications that we must avoid, and we must remember Jesus’ statements on what it meant to be his mother and brothers and sisters in the gospels (i.e. that those who followed him were those really deserving of the titles). However, simply to set aside the title is to lose important aspects of the reality of the incarnation. If we say that Mary was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the mother of God, we are really saying either that she was not truly the mother of Jesus, or that Jesus was not fully God. Neither of these is a tolerable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to those qualifications. When we say that Mary is the mother of God, we are not saying that God in any sense has his source in her. All of the humanity of Jesus finds its source equally in Mary and in the Spirit’s divine intervention —but Mary was created by the Son, rather than the Son originating in her. Mary is the mother of God in Christ, but she is not to the Son exactly as ordinary mothers are to ordinary sons, for Jesus was not an ordinary son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor do we mean that Mary has special prerogatives because of her relationship to Jesus. As noted above, Jesus made clear that he was concerned above all with obedience to the will of God (see e.g. Matthew 12:46–50). Thus, the devotions offered to Mary by our Catholic and Eastern Orthodox brothers and sisters is misplaced, as is the notion that her prayers are somehow more effective in touching Jesus’ heart than are those of the ordinary saint who is seeking to honor God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These qualifications notwithstanding, we must still be willing and ready to affirm that Mary was in fact the Mother of God. To do otherwise is to reduce in one way or another the mystery of the incarnation. It is not so much that &lt;em&gt;Mary&lt;/em&gt; is important here as that affirming her motherhood of God helps us affirm the important points to which we must hold fast in terms the full deity and full humanity of &lt;em&gt;Christ&lt;/em&gt;. Mary is important because Jesus humanity came by means of Mary’s body. Everything that it is to be man, Jesus always was from conception, and everything that it is to be God, Jesus always was from the moment of his conception.&lt;/p&gt;

In my view, however, the question is impossible to answer. I do not think Scripture speaks with sufficient clarity on the matter. We know on the one hand that all are “by nature children of wrath” (Ephesians 2:3), and that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). What neither of these texts tell us, though, and what indeed &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; text tells us, is whether people are guilty at birth or whether they are simply sinful and become guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could reason to a conclusion that accords with our other theological commitments with little difficulty. We know that God is just, and punishes for the wrongs we commit, but we have no evidence that he punishes wrongs we &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; commit, and therefore we might conclude that he would therefore not find guilty any newly conceived or newly born person. On the other hand, we also must reckon with the reality that the Scriptures treat questions of progeny far differently than do individually-minded modern Westerners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripture points us to the God who “will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation” (Exodus 34:7) as well as the God who proclaims that “The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son” (Ezekiel 18:20). Paul did write that “one trespass led to condemnation for all men,” but he immediately follows up this provocative statement by arguing that “one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men” (Romans 5:18)—yet we know that Paul does not (and cannot) here mean that all men are saved, for we know that he believes that those who do not repent and believe the gospel perish in their sins under the expectation of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot from the evidence that God has given us decide this question. We are left without an answer. If we grant the sufficiency of Scripture, then we must recognize that if there are questions God has in his wisdom opted not to answer, it is for a reason, and we should cease with our speculations and be silent. We may not know whether infants are &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt;, but we do know two other things that are far more important than that: First, God is merciful and gracious and just. We will not in the final reckoning find his justice lacking or his treatment of (for example) those who died in infancy to be lacking. Second, all are born under the dual curse of sin’s hold and death’s certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These truths give us clear and straightforward points of application. First, we must preach the gospel clearly to people of every age and intellectual ability, for even little children sin and death is awaiting us all. Whether or not we are born guilty, we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; guilty very quickly. Second, much of the speculation on this question—and many churches practices such as infant baptism—seems to be rooted in worry about the fate of those who die young, without having made a credible profession of faith. Yet even if we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to the question of their guilt, we still might not know God’s response. Even did we know the answer, still we would need learn to trust in the goodness and wisdom of God in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

What is perhaps less clear is why that particular act was sinful. Was it disobedience? gaining knowledge? pride? idolatry? The most straightforward reading of Genesis 3 makes it clear that the act was sinful at the most basic level because it was disobedience, a direct rejection of the stated will of God. God tells Adam that the consequences he receives are because he ate of the tree from which he was commanded not to eat (3:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the more interesting question, then, is why disobedience to God is a sin. As Christians, we acknowledge that the Bible teaches us this truth. Digging deeper is helpful in understanding many things about God and the nature of both humanity and the shape of the world we inhabit. To describe why disobedience is sinful, though, requires that we first define what sin &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Sin is, at the most basic level, failure—missing the mark, as the Greek word would have it. The next question, then, is: &lt;em&gt;Failure at what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is failure to be what humans were (and still are) meant to be—a mystery of ages, to which we have the answer. Genesis tells us exactly who we humans are. We are made in the image of God. We are to be small icons of divine glory. The divinity we are meant to recapitulate in miniature exists in perfect harmony, is completely wise and wholly good, and exercises utter sovereignty. Women and men are meant likewise to exist in true harmony, to be wise in right measure and truly good, and to exercise sovereignty in our appointed spheres. This is what it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; to be human: to do as God does in the ways he appoints in the world he made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; at that task is no small thing. It is to fail in the most significant way possible. Worse still, to fail as Adam and Eve did (and as we all have ever since) can only happen in a conscious act. Yes, our natures are now so corrupted that we all sin incidentally, too. But we all of us sin on purpose. Our first father and mother did not fail accidentally. They willfully rejected the very reason for their existence and spat in the face of the author of that existence. (Here is the source of the human struggle for existential meaning and the dread of meaningless that plagues us.) They rejected both the shape of reality and the one who made reality. They rebelled. They became traitors against the universe’s God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their sin, then, was not only disobedience. There are times when disobedience might be right: one &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; reject unjust commands. This, however, was not such a command. Their act of disobedience included both mistrust of most trustworthy God and self-exaltation over and against the only exalted God. God does not only demand our allegiance, he &lt;em&gt;deserves&lt;/em&gt; it. He requires our worship not because he is vain, but because to worship anything else, however lovely, is to do injury to the object of that worship, to ourselves, and to the Triune Godhead. Adam and Eve’s eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good represented precisely that offense. They rejected God’s sovereignty, his wisdom and goodness, and even fellowship with him. They rejected their own sphere of sovereignty, chose quick knowledge over wisdom, deceit over goodness, and treachery over communion.&lt;/p&gt;
