&lt;h1&gt;Part I: Argument for Realism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction-definition-constraints" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Introduction, Definition, Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these facts… are so striking, because there was no reason &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; to expect man to be able to achieve such cognitive feats, because no undertaking can guarantee success &lt;em&gt;of this particular sort&lt;/em&gt;, we are confronted with a genuine problem: why is science so successful?&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;(Laudan 1984, 89)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of science over the last four hundred years has produced a radical increase in effective prediction of natural phenomena across a wide array of domains. It has also yielded a striking ability to intervene successfully in the natural world in areas as diverse as biology and medicine on the one hand, and particle physics and the development of computing technology on the other. Yet, when scientists speak of electrons, quarks, dark matter, and so on—phenomena not directly accessible to ordinary human experience, but in many cases directly related to this empirical and technological success—it is an open question in philosophy of science whether such entities really exist, or are merely useful ways of solving problems and dealing with data. Scientific realism is the affirmation that the entities postulated by scientific theories actually do exist. This claim does not entail the success of all scientific theories, and is therefore not compromised by the failure and replacement of some scientific theories. Nor does it require that all theories be embraced equally firmly. It simply means the claims and practice of science do really, if only approximately, describe the world. This paper will argue that critical realism is the best explanation for science’s success, and that it correctly characterizes the relationship between scientific models and the world they describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="reasons-for-accepting-realism" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Reasons for Accepting Realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-analogical-reasoning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;a. Analogical Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most straightforward arguments in favor of scientific realism is the intuition toward realism in general. When a detective examines a murder scene, she tends to assume the hypothesized criminal actually exists. Further analysis may or may not bear out the initial hypothesis about who committed a crime—perhaps it was a psychotic killer escaped from a mental ward, not an acquaintance of the deceased—but her normal faculties reliably point toward real entities in the world. Moreover, the process of analysis generally leads an (honest) investigator toward an increasingly accurate mental picture of the perpetrator. Missteps may occur in the analysis, but are amenable to critical reassessment, so that even when the revision from the original hypothesis is substantial, the trend-line of the mental model is toward increasing accuracy. The basic picture was refined, not destroyed: the victim was not after all killed by a wizard from Alpha Centauri (and even that would be a malicious, person-like agent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, on a realist view, operates similarly. Initial hypotheses may prove to have more or less in common with the real world, and not only may but &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be subject to revision, even radical revision along the way. However, theories should be treated realistically, both ontologically (there really is something out there to know) and epistemically (science grants access to reality, albeit in approximate and limited fashion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary argument against this analogy toward scientific realism is the idea of in-principle unobservables.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The crime scene investigator has direct experience of things like criminals (other human persons, at least) as well as of the evidence itself. No one has direct experience of electrons. More than this, the postulates of quantum mechanics (are taken to) suggest that no one &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have such direct experience. Then, the antirealist argues, the scientific claim is at best unknowable: electrons may exist, but scientists have no way of knowing. They may observe a trail in a gas cloud, but whether the thing leaving the trail is really like an electron is unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any such attempt to distinguish in principle between observables and unobservables fails.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, antirealists use “unobservable” to mean anything not directly observable by human senses. However, declaring such objects in-principle unobservable is question-begging: the point under debate is just whether things detected indirectly are being observed or simply hypothesized. Antirealists must first establish such an in-principle distinction between indirect and direct observation. Realists note that indirect observation is rightly considered reliable in the realm of ordinary experience, and can rationally be extended analogically. It is reasonable to conclude that the wind is blowing from seeing its effects on trees even if sitting inside a closed room (with no direct experience of the wind). This would be so even for a person who had spent his entire life locked up inside and therefore had never had direct experiential access to wind or trees. Indirect observations still count as observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-whole-cloth-reasoning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;b. Whole-Cloth Reasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, human reasoning seems to be “whole cloth.” It is difficult (if not impossible) to find any particular line, even a blurry one, where this kind of inferential reasoning becomes suspect.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Granted that electrons are quite different from anything of which humans have direct experience, this is not finally telling against reasoning about them. Humans are quite capable of making the requisite fine distinctions required for analogical reasoning to be valid; indeed, scientific models of electrons expressly include both similarities to and sharp discontinuities with human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a realist view rightly makes sense of the way “observability” lies along a spectrum. On one end are those phenomena which can be detected through (normal, healthy) human senses such as hearing or vision. Moving down toward the not-directly-observable spectrum, scientists use telescopes and microscopes to enhance their ability to observe things inaccessible to ordinary human sight because of distance and size respectively. In both cases, however, there is no clear line distinguishing “observable” from “unobservable”—only a spectrum of more- or less-&lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt;-observable phenomena. Insects may be observed with the unaided human eye, bacteria with optical microscopes, individual molecules of materials with electron microscopes. In each case, the same principle is at work in the observation: light bouncing off an object and being received.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;(Maxwell 1962, 4–11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-realist may object: the fact that the distinction between observables and unobservables is blurry does not mean it does not exist. As Samir Okasha notes, the line between “bald” and “hirsute” may be fuzzy (pun intended), but it is still possible to identify a bald man.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;(2002, 69–70)&lt;/span&gt; Even granting the in-principle distinction between “observable” and “unobservable,” however, the objection fails to establish the strong claim made by antirealists. It does not establish that the items in question are in fact unobservable (especially when confronted with the realist argument for indirect observation). Nor does it establish that scientists would be in principle incapable of correctly modeling unobservables. At most, it establishes that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be unobservable phenomena.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;(Okasha 2002, 70)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that though current models of astronomical behavior, or of quantum mechanics, or gravity, or any other only-indirectly-observable phenomena may be incomplete or partial, they nonetheless represent something &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;. There really is an electron leaving a trail in the gas chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="c.-no-miracles" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;c. No Miracles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substantial success of science in both predicting and providing coherent explanations for empirical phenomena, it seems &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; strange that the hypotheses in question would have nothing whatsoever to do with reality. It would be a miracle of sorts if a set of theories which do not directly rely on each other would all work effectively, and effectively &lt;em&gt;in conjunction&lt;/em&gt;, while not actually saying anything true about the world. These predictions are more than merely theoretically interesting; they have real-world application used every day: “laser technology is based on a theory about what happens when electrons in an atom go from higher to lower energy-states. And lasers work…”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="okasha:science-introduction"&gt;(Okasha 2002)&lt;/span&gt; It seems reasonable that one reason scientific theories have been so successful is that they are approximately accurate, and increasingly so over time (if in fits and sometimes with false starts).&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="putnam:mathematics:1979 vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(So Putnam 1979, 72–73; and &lt;em&gt;contra&lt;/em&gt; Fraassen 1980, 39.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many critics think the evidence of change in adoption of given theories, and varying degrees of empirical success over time, is hard evidence against the notion that scientific theories generally do refer in this way. Similarly, some theories once held to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; are now thought to be neither approximately true, nor even subsets of what is true. Larry Laudan, citing a number of changes in this vein, sniffs: “The realist’s claim that we should expect referring theories to be empirically successful is simply false.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:confutation"&gt;(Laudan 1981, 24)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the fact that science is an iterative and approximative process does not tell against the realism asserted. Any given theory may be substantially false. This does not mean all theories are &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; not to refer, only that realists must be critical, aware of the possibility of failure, and willing to hold their claims tentatively, especially at first. No scientist with a knowledge of the history of the discipline should think otherwise. Electrons might not exist; but at least for the present, there is good reason to treat them not only as useful but as real. The longer the predictions of the model are (not dis)confirmed by the evidence, the more reason scientists have for holding the conclusion confidently. Likewise, as other theories developed without direct reference provide further corroboration, it is increasingly rational to affirm a theory as true, as well as empirically useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, even if Laudan’s point is granted, it does not disprove realism. It simply proves naïve realism false—naïve, even. True: empirical success does not guarantee the truthlikeness of a theory, and vice versa. It does not follow that there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; correspondence between the two. Laudan insists that the truthlikeness of a given theory has zero bearing on its empirical fruitfulness, but it is at least possible that it is instead a contributory factor.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-atomic-theory-lets-could-use-some-clarification-in-later-drafts.-if-the-reader-doesnt-know-the-relevant-science-this-isnt-sufficiently-clear." class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;“The atomic theory lets…” could use some clarification in later drafts. If the reader doesn’t know the relevant science, this isn’t sufficiently clear.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what about later theories which do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make special cases of the earlier theory? When Laudan, Kuhn, van Fraassen, and others examine e.g. the fluid and aether theories and compare them to the atomic theories now held by most physicists, they note that science has been empirically useful without being true in the past; the same may be true today. However, later views, currently held by realists to be accurate, can often explain the success of the earlier theory even without claiming it as a subset.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="putnam:three-kinds-of-realism"&gt;(Cf. Putnam 1982, 197–99)&lt;/span&gt; The atomic theory lets scientists explain the appearance of the aether. Newton’s mechanics can be applied to show why Ptolemy’s epicycles worked, even though they were false. The later theory not only has greater empirical success; its explanatory power also includes the now disconfirmed theory—whether as a special case or not. To be sure, the idea that all science proceeds linearly and that every theory is this kind of empirical superset of the former is incorrect.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still, the fact that later theories &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; can do so is further evidence that truthlikeness is a contributory factor in the success of scientific theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="alternatives-to-realism" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Alternatives to Realism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two broad categories of antirealism, rational and non-rational, both deny the rationality of believing science truly describes the world.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Larry Laudan’s instrumentalism, Bas C. van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, and J. P. Moreland’s eclectic approach are &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; antirealisms. They all affirm the rationality of the scientific enterprise and reject conceptual relativism.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 194)&lt;/span&gt; Non-rational antirealisms such as a strong Kuhnian approach deny the rationality of science and affirm conceptual relativism. Each fails as a critique of or alternative to critical realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-larry-laudans-instrumentalism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;a. Larry Laudan’s Instrumentalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrumentalism takes the effectiveness of science as indicating only its effectiveness in delivering more reliable predictions.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;(Laudan 1984, 91)&lt;/span&gt; Philosophers like Larry Laudan reject as both irrelevant and false the idea of “partial truth” or “verisimilitude” as incoherent: in a semantic model, statements are either true or false. This is partly fair: scientists claim their models have a semantic content corresponding approximately to the world. Yet the critique fails to account for the way scientists use the notion of “approximate-ness.” Models may be incomplete, yet yield correct results &lt;em&gt;when the approximation is appropriate&lt;/em&gt;. There are thus three important distinctions to be made. The first is between accuracy (how near the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; value a given experiment is) and precision (the repeatability of a measurement). An archer who consistently shoots four inches to the right of the bullseye is precise but not accurate; one who is always within two inches of the target but all around it is accurate, but not precise. The second is between accuracy and the philosophical binary of truth. A scientific model might in the strict sense be “false”—that is, even its predictions are not empirically &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, only &lt;em&gt;close to correct&lt;/em&gt;, while the model may be more accurate than any previous model. An arrow is either within the bullseye or not, but there is more to scoring an archery contest—and more to evaluating the accuracy of scientific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third distinction, and the most serious, is between models’ empirical content and their semantic content. A theory might be said to be “more true,” i.e. more &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;, than any predecessor, if it is more consistent with the empirical data or capable of explaining a broader set of such data. However, the semantic claim is more likely to be binary. Either there are electrons, or there are not. If not, there may be nothing very much like electrons at all. Even so, this distinction is less sharp than Laudan supposes. Increasing approximation of reality is possible. Models may have more or less fidelity. A perfectly round globe may strictly be a false representation of the earth, which is slightly squashed due to its spin; but it is nearer correct than a piece of paper or a donut. The earth is much more like a sphere than a plane or a toroid. If reality is more like the Standard Model of quantum mechanics’ description of electrons and quarks than it is like a pre-atomic view of reality, the Standard Model is a better approximation to reality than the pre-atomic view. Voiding the distinction between accuracy and binary truth is simply a category mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally Laudan shows how the scientific methodologies developed over the past several hundred years work, but not &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;—especially in cases quite different from his example of double-blind clinical studies.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;(Laudan 1984, 98–100)&lt;/span&gt; In scenarios where technological control over the environment is at stake, science clearly has an edge on other methods (so his critique of relativism stands).&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(cf. Fraassen 1980, 40)&lt;/span&gt; It is less clear why drug trials should be amenable to this sort of testing if the human body and drug interactions are not &lt;em&gt;more like&lt;/em&gt; the scientific models than the non-scientific models. It was precisely the belief in the accuracy of such models which gave rise to the instrumentally effective methodology! One might posit, then, that &lt;em&gt;realism itself&lt;/em&gt; is instrumentally useful in the pursuit of these technological gains. The problem, of course, is that such an epistemic stance is difficult to maintain at best. It is one thing (and not a very controversial one) to say that the scientific method is instrumentally effective. It is another to say that belief in scientific realism is instrumentally effective and false, because no one can sustain a belief they think false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-bas-c.-van-fraassen-and-constructive-empiricism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;b. Bas C. van Fraassen and Constructive Empiricism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bas C. van Fraassen’s constructive empiricist model, science is (or at least should be) concerned solely with explaining the empirical data available to the human senses. Theories are useful but not true; they “do much besides answer the factual questions about regularities in the observable phenomena which, according to empiricism, are the scientist’s basic topic of concern.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(Fraassen 1980, 70)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least three major problems confront van Fraassen’s view. One is van Fraassen’s prior commitment to materialist empiricism. He asserts, for example, that criteria such as mathematical elegance, simplicity, scope, completion, unification, and explanatory “provide reasons for using a theory… and &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; rationally guide our epistemic attitudes and decisions.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(Fraassen 1980, 87)&lt;/span&gt; Why? Because he regards human observational powers as the sole grounds of knowledge. As such, he also rejects any critique of the limitations of “sense data” or problems with human perception as “armchair psychology” which can safely be ignored.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(Fraassen 1980, 72)&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; point of interest, for van Fraassen, is explaining those regularities in observable phenomena. As Grover Maxwell comments, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely the main concerns of, say, a theoretical physicist involve such things as the actual properties and varieties of subatomic particles rather than mere predictions about where and how intense a certain spectral line will be.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;(1962, 19–20)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even in conducting their ordinary research, theoretical physicists and chemists are concerned with things they think actually exist. However much van Fraassen thinks science &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; only concern itself with those regularities, realism seems basic to the scientific endeavor as actually practiced.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem for van Fraassen is closely related to the first: “empirical adequacy” is a necessary but insufficient condition for the acceptance of a scientific theory. Scientists do (and must) embrace those other conditions for accepting theories as true, and rightly so. Nothing about using those criteria to decide between theories is irrational in the least apart from van Fraassen’s prior commitment to empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, van Fraassen simply reasserts the distinction between observable and unobservable entities. He begins with the idea of in-principle unobservability, but on encountering Maxwell’s argument from technological improvements, he moves the goalposts. He has in mind, he says, the limitations of human beings “&lt;em&gt;qua&lt;/em&gt; human beings;” technological aids actual or imaginable are irrelevant.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(Fraassen 1980, 18)&lt;/span&gt; As shown above, though, the lack of any such clear distinction is the major problem for the antirealist interested in maintaining this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="c.-morelands-selective-antirealism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;c. Moreland’s Selective Antirealism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. P. Moreland suggests an alternative from within a Christian epistemology and ontology. He fully grants a generally realist epistemology and affirms a correspondence view of truth. However, he also approves a cautiously eclectic approach to &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; realism.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 193–41)&lt;/span&gt; He offers two major criteria for adopting antirealist stances. The first is “in those cases where the phenomena described by that theory lie outside the appropriate domain of science, or the scientific aspect of some phenomenon is inappropriately taken to be the whole phenomenon itself.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 206)&lt;/span&gt; For example: scientific explanations of mind currently tend toward reductive physicalism. But if there are good reasons to suspect that the mind is not reducible to the brain (say: the whole history of dualist arguments), any scientific theory which purports to explain mind solely in terms of material function should be treated antirealistically—as instrumentally useful, but not &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. But a critically realist claim about physical-mental state correlation does not entail physicalism. Rather, the physicalist claim is not scientific but philosophical. This should certain chasten the materialists, but it is not proof against realism—not generally, and not even in the case of this specific theory. It is proof only against unwarranted extension from the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreland also argues that “an antirealist stances should be taken toward some scientific theory in those cases where a realist view conflicts with a rationally well-established conceptual problem for that theory but an antirealist view does not.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 210)&lt;/span&gt; He suggests that the logically problematic claims of some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest a non-realist interpretation: “the indeterminacy in nature is due to the uncertainty of our knowledge of nature or our inability to measure nature and is not a feature of nature itself.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 210)&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, if there are good philosophical reasons for rejecting infinite regress, one should be confident rejecting even an instrumentally-useful cosmological model of an infinite universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these latter examples, however, as well as in the further criteria he briefly mentions,&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreland lumps together two distinct phenomena under the same label of “anti-realism.” One is an in-principle denial that certain kinds of data are available to us; the other a denial that a &lt;em&gt;specific model&lt;/em&gt; comports with reality. One might think that all theories about electrons are permanently subject to antirealist critiques and that we can have no true knowledge of such allegedly unobservable entities. This is quite different from thinking that a given cosmological model is wrong. Both entail prior commitments, and the warrant in both cases arises outside science. They are nonetheless different kinds of claims: one about what is knowable, and one about what actually is. Even if Moreland’s criteria were granted, this is very different from van Fraassen’s empiricism or Laudan’s instrumentalism. Rejecting a given theory is quite different from rejecting the possibility of a theory being true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="d.-non-rational-antirealism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;d. Non-Rational Antirealism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest form of Thomas Kuhn’s description of scientific history emphasizes that the theories on either side of a scientific revolution are totally incommensurable, actually operating in “different worlds.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;(Kuhn [1962] 2012, 111)&lt;/span&gt; The shift away from Aristotelian is one where Galileo &lt;em&gt;saw differently&lt;/em&gt; than he had before.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kuhn’s protests that he understands the problem with the phrase notwithstanding, he regularly reverts to the idea that scientists before and after revolutions lived in different worlds.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;(e.g. his discussion of chemistry in Kuhn [1962] 2012, 133)&lt;/span&gt; This cannot be right: even if the theories are distinct in important ways, and even if are not totally commensurable, there are certainly data on which they can agree. Even if what the planets were seen &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; shifted between the Ptolemaic and the Keplerian eras, the basic observational data were agreeable to both, for example. Likewise, though mass has different semantic content in the Newtonian and Einsteinian conceptions, both agree on many of the empirical values—including problematic measurements which prompted to the transition between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken as a chastening of overconfident or naïve realism Kuhn’s historical critique is to be appreciated. His view of scientific revolutions leads him (or at least many of his readers) further, though—to conclude that observation is so theory-laden that, though the objective world is “out there” to describe, humans have no true access to it. The data itself is always subject to the flux of another revolution. Such a view, whatever its attractions, is first of all suspect simply on the reality that scientific approaches &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; accomplished goals (like predicting and controlling floods) which cut across scientific and non-scientific cultures.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;(Laudan 1984, 94–95)&lt;/span&gt; Second, any such non-rational antirealism stands clearly opposed to the Biblical idea that truth is knowable and that both moral and empirical data may be true or not—that the final standard is not human knowledge but the God-created reality outside the human knower. Third, such a view is self-defeating, as it claims objective knowledge about scientific theories while purporting that no such objective knowledge is possible.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(So, rightly, Moreland 1989, 201–2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion-the-best-option" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Conclusion: The Best Option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific realism, then, is the best option. It has its limitations, and specific theories may well not be finally accurate descriptions of reality. Phlogiston, after all, is not real; it may turn out that quarks are not either. But neither radical skepticism nor even hard agnosticism are therefore warranted. Rather, a critical realism which acknowledges the limitations and possibility for inaccuracy in any given model is far more appropriate. This model best accounts for both science’s instrumental effectiveness as a standalone discipline and its applicability to other disciplines. It best makes sense of the philosophical issues around epistemology and ontology. It best explains how scientific theories advance over time, not necessarily linearly but such that later models to tend to be capable of treating earlier models either as special cases or as comprehensible misunderstandings. Not least, it best comports with the Biblical view of truth and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id="part-ii-excursusrealism-and-creationism" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Part II: Excursus—Realism and Creationism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antirealism holds an undeniable appeal to many young-earth creationists. If science is meaningful only in a pragmatic sense, then the creationist may happily accept the utility of science for technological innovation, while still rejecting scientific claims about the age of the earth and common descent of living organisms without any serious conflict. As Moreland comments, “After all, if one does not assume that evolutionary theory is approximately true or objectively rational, then why bother to argue against it or to integrate Christian theological claims about the history of life with evolutionary theory?”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 142)&lt;/span&gt; The more traditional (and admittedly more straightforward) reading of the Genesis narrative may be maintained, and the propositions of secular science safely sidelined as merely useful models which say nothing about the actual world. More, the off-putting claim often associated with scientific realism, “that science or the scientific method represents the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; (or, more weakly, the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;) effective instrument for discovering truths about the world”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="laudan:beyond-realism"&gt;(Laudan 1984, 85)&lt;/span&gt; may be safely rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excursus aims to show that, whatever the appeals of an antirealist stance for young-earth creationism, such a view is deeply mistaken. First, as seen above in Part I, there are good reasons to embrace realism in general, and to reject the major alternatives on offer. Second, even if one embraces an eclectic stance, &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; J. P. Moreland, the relevant criteria do not apply to the creation-science debate specifically. Third, in order for the antirealist objection to prove useful in the creation-science debate, it must go far beyond those criteria anyway—it must treat nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; modern science antirealistically. It smuggles in a radical skepticism not especially congenial to Christian thought. It proves too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-argument-applied" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The Argument Applied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constructive empiricist program has severe problems for the Christian. As van Fraassen freely admits in the introduction to “The Scientific Image”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By empiricism I mean the philosophical position that experience is our source of information about the world, &lt;em&gt;and our only source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="vanfraassen:scientific-image"&gt;(Fraassen 1980, 8, emphasis mine.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for a constructive empiricist view of science, then, is expressly the defense of empiricism. But empiricism as a worldview is antithetical to Christianity. Grover Maxwell searingly points out the underlying philosophical commitment: “the conviction that there are very few ontologically legitimate kinds of entities, perhaps only one.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="maxwell:theoretical-entities"&gt;(Maxwell 1962, 27)&lt;/span&gt; Empiricism as an all-encompassing &lt;em&gt;gestalt&lt;/em&gt; must be distinguished from the employment of empirical methods within other paradigms, of course: the Christian believes that the God-given senses are broadly trustworthy as a means of acquiring knowledge. However, Christians do (and must) affirm that non-empirical sources of data provide real warrant for belief: particularly divine revelation. Constructive empiricism is plainly antithetical to Christian theism—and certainly no friend to a claim about the age of the earth driven entirely by special revelatory considerations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the two kinds of anti-realism regularly embraced by young-earth creationists are instrumentalism and J. P. Moreland’s eclectic antirealism. Instrumentalism is at least at first blush much more appealing an option for Christians than empiricism. It allows the believer to affirm that science produces enormously helpful insights for technological advancement and control of the world.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Beyond the basic critiques of instrumentalism noted in Part I, however, there are further problems for the young-earth creationist considering instrumentalism as an “out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one might reject scientific approaches for measuring the age of fossils or the earth itself. Current isotope decay rates explain some observations, and are technologically applicable to e.g. managing nuclear reactors—but they are merely useful, not true. As such, they are certainly not applicable to the past. Therefore, any claims about their past behavior should thereby be ruled out of bounds. Granted that the past is strictly inaccessible to scientists, this should still give the young-earth antirealist some pause. Dating a manuscript or a particular piece of pottery is not terribly dissimilar to dating a fossil. Taking this stance equally rules out much of the archaeological support mustered for the antiquity of the Bible. For that matter, how can one know that paper did not transmute words in the past? Claiming that documents changed their meaning would seem patently silly, but there is no more and no less evidence for it than that isotope decay rates have changed. Historical investigation of any sort, but especially archaeology, depends on the accessibility of the past much as geology does. It is not at all clear that reasoning about the earth suddenly becomes out of bounds at some arbitrary point far enough back in the past, or that radiometric isotopes should be assumed to be reliable up to a given point but no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, while astronomy and geology seem at least partly to follows Laudan’s model of problem-solving—the practice of the disciplines results in more empirically-adequate explanations over time&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—his pragmatic approach asserts that science never approaches the truth whatsoever. Science solves empirical problems and helps humans accomplish certain technical tasks, but it reveals nothing of the world itself. Like van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, it is thus contrary to the biblical view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="morelands-criteria" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Moreland’s Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, many young-earth creationists such as Ken Ham take an explicitly realist stance toward science overall, arguing for something like the eclectic realism of J. P. Moreland, rather than a true instrumentalism or empiricism. This makes sense: it seems that one or more of J. P. Moreland’s criteria for eclectic antirealism might give warrant for taking an antirealist stance toward some of the relevant theories. However, even if Moreland is right that “We should not automatically assume that if science and theology conflict… the scientific theory should be read in realist terms and attacked accordingly,”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 211)&lt;/span&gt; there remain two major problems with applying Moreland’s criteria in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, even if Moreland’s criteria for skepticism are valid, they are not applicable to the majority of the data under consideration in creationist arguments about e.g. the age of the earth. His first criterion certainly does not apply: the investigation of questions like the age of the earth or the life-cycle of stars or even the relationship between various kinds of life on earth all seem to be well within the legitimate territory of scientific explanation. His second criterion, having “a rationally well-established conceptual problem for that theory [which] an antirealist view does not,”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 210)&lt;/span&gt; seems more applicable. Surely a well-established history of young-earth exegesis counts as a “rationally well-established conceptual problem”? Indeed, this is the strongest argument in favor Moreland’s eclectic empiricism applied to the issue. But of course, interpretations of the early chapters of Genesis have varied widely throughout the history of the church. This suggests at the least that the problem is less well-established that its proponents might think or hope. Moreover, it is relatively straightforward to propose readings of the creation narratives which accord with both the rest of Scripture &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with science—far more straightforward than to propose entirely new, mutually compatible systems of physics, geology, biology, etc. The shoe seems to be on the other foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Moreland’s other suggested criteria?&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 211)&lt;/span&gt; Most of the fields are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; especially young.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Few of them (especially the cornerstone fields of astronomy, geology, and particle physics) have experienced a large proportion of theory replacement over refinement of existing theories. None of the fields are in a period of Kuhnian crisis. One stronger contender is that “non rational, sociological factors account for much of the theory’s acceptance by the scientific community.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 211)&lt;/span&gt; This certainly looks to be the case in some ways, and it is fair to critique the scientific community on those terms. However, the same could equally be said of the young-earth creationist stance itself: it has at times been difficult even to get a job in conservative evangelical institutions while denying young-earth creationism.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, although the critique stands for some of the fields, it is certainly not applicable to all of them; there is no particular sociological pressure on findings about isotope decay rates relevant to the discussion, for example. Finally, one might claim of evolutionary biology that “the main virtue… is its empirical adequacy, and its more metaphysical, theoretical aspects can be understood as unnecessary, excess baggage”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(Moreland 1989, 211)&lt;/span&gt;—but again, the same can hardly be said of isotope decay or stellar life-cycle theories, neither of which has particularly strong metaphysical implications here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, related problem—conflating two distinct phenomena into a single label of “antirealism”—was noted above but warrants further discussion.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moreland:science:1989"&gt;(cf. Moreland 1989, 206–11)&lt;/span&gt; Again: one (strict instrumentalism or van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism) is an in-principle denial that certain kinds of data are available to us; the other a denial that a specific model is correct. So for example, one might think that all theories about electrons are permanently subject to antirealist critiques and that we can have no true knowledge of such allegedly unobservable entities; we can never know whether our theories about these things are in fact &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of whether this claim is correct, it is quite different from thinking that a given cosmological model is wrong, while another one is correct (and demonstrably so if certain key assumptions were to be revisited). Both of these entail prior philosophical commitments, and in both cases the warrant for critiquing the realist claim arises outside of science itself, e.g. from a commitment to empiricism, or from a specific reading of Scripture. But they are nonetheless different kinds of claims: one about what is knowable, and one about what actually is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can of course imagine an antirealist critique of the former sort being levied against some cosmological model or another, but this is not what young-earth creationists who adopt an antirealist stance toward cosmology (Moreland included) seem to be proposing. Moreover, precisely because these are different kinds of claims, the kinds of warrant for skepticism that are in play for scientific knowledge about electrons or quarks are quite different both in principle and practice from the relevant factors for cosmology, geology, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking an anti-realist stance toward these phenomena, then, requires a radical degree of skepticism—more radical than Moreland’s criteria warrant, and as it turns out with rather sharp consequences for other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="severe-and-undesirable-consequences" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Severe and Undesirable Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not sufficient to grant a certain suspicion about unobserved or indirectly observed phenomena.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rather, the would-be &lt;em&gt;creationist&lt;/em&gt; antirealist must commit to rejecting the realist validity of some or all the claims of: nuclear physics, geology, and paleontology (with serious repercussions to archaeology); general relativity; evolutionary biology; and observational astronomy (with direct application to cosmology). The consequences are no less devastating for the Christian worldview than for the physicalist,&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; albeit for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the no-miracles argument applies not only to the question of realism in general but also to the age of the earth and universe specifically. It is profoundly unlikely that one could derive an empirically adequate scientific model of something like fundamental particles without any correspondence to reality. It is at least as unlikely that findings from a variety of unrelated fields should all agree, while also all being totally wrong. Though some young-earth creationists chalk up this outcome to conspiratorial forces in the sciences (so Henry Morris) or to the presuppositions held by non-Christian scientists (so many disciples of Van Til), the claim both strains credulity and also—more to the point—is simply inaccurate both historically and in the present. The history of scientific estimates of the age of the earth is particularly illuminating; committed Christian Lord Kelvin’s early and foundational work already pointed to an age in the millions of years at a minimum. Likewise, many working Christian scientists today find the evidence for the antiquity of the earth and the universe quite reasonable, and they would be neither member of a Morrisian conspiracy nor, as regenerate believers, subject to precisely the same Van Tillian noetic defects as their non-Christian colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent lines of evidence for the antiquity of the universe and the earth include: astronomical observation and theories of star formation; cosmological development models and the prediction and discovery of the Big Bang background radiation in line with those models; geological and paleontological observations and associated data from decay rates which derive from fundamental physics. Many of these lines of data arose independently but have since been found to confirm one another. For example, isotopic decay rates are both predicted by particle physics and well-verified, and provide an independent line of evidence for the age of the earth in line with the ways of estimating that age: from patterns of stratification, to tree ring samples, to similar measurements of the age of other objects in the solar system. Models built up from the plate-tectonic theory of geology corroborates paleontological evidence of geographic colocation of certain species in the past. Radiometric dating of the age of the earth also accords with analyses of the age of the universe based on current models of star life-cycles and the formation of heavy elements, which in turn accord with models of cosmological development. These astronomical observations and analyses depend on both general and special relativity as well. Moreover, the evidence for these individual claims appears quite defensible to many confessing evangelical Christians. That &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these independent lines of evidence, leaning on nearly every major area of physics, earth science, and biology should coincide at all—much less so neatly—while being entirely false is just the kind of miracle subject to the critique levied above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this kind of strong antirealism leads to a radical skepticism that seems very out of keeping with Scriptural teaching on the role of nature. Surely passages such as Psalm 19 and Romans 1 indicate clearly that the world has a kind of revelatory content, which points to the nature of the one who created it. But imagine the young-earth creationist adopts an antirealist stance toward astronomical observation as a way of rejecting the apparent age of the universe. This requires asserting all of the following: No star has gone supernova before the last 10,000 years, and thus the heavy elements were all created “in situ” and are not, as currently believed, the product of supernovae. Indeed, any kind of apparent stellar life-cycle is an illusion (or at least: has never actually been experienced by any star). The evidence of background radiation is merely coincidence, and is in fact unrelated to the apparent expansion of the universe indicated by the red-shift of stars further from the earth. The apparent expansion of the universe is just that: apparent only; it has only ever been fractionally different than it is. Whatever the apparent evidence, the light seen is not in fact from the stars apparently observed: given the apparent distance to most stars, and the best models of how stars work, many of the stars in the night sky would have ceased to be visible, whether by exploding into supernovae or by burning down to white dwarfs, long before they were actually created. In other words, there is literally nothing true revealed by observing the stars—not even the brute fact of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much the same could be said for the other sciences. The earth shows apparent geological history including incredible catastrophes—ice ages, impacts from meteors, and so on—which in point of fact &lt;em&gt;never happened&lt;/em&gt;. This is far more radical than instrumentalism, and stronger even than van Fraassen’s empiricism. It even goes beyond the kinds of claims advanced by the conceptual relativists. There is no possible evidence which could countervail against it. It is sheer fideism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antirealism, particularly of the instrumental or eclectic varieties, may seem appealing to Christians troubled by the claims advanced by modern science. Whether the concern is with a kind of materialist “scientism” which strongly asserts a monadic view of human consciousness, or the apparent contradictions between Scripture and claims about the age of the universe, treating science as useful but not necessarily &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; seems a helpful escape-hatch. However, adopting such a stance brings along so many other, and such severe, problems that whatever gains appears in this area seem not to be worth the cost—especially if there are other means of reconciling a realist view of science with Scripture’s teaching. Note that this does not mean that young-earth creationism is wrong. There may be other good reasons, including scientific reasons, to think that the earth is young.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Programs of research oriented this direction may be fully realist while not affirming the veracity of any particular model. The distinction between principled antirealism and the rejection of a given theory is helpful and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at times maintain their views in the face of contrary evidence, or because of presuppositions they refuse to relinquish. But so may exegetes. If there is good reason to be a realist about science generally (and there is), and seemingly good evidence for the age of the earth (and there is), it behooves Christians at the least to hold their young-earth views tentatively. The strength of the claim that the earth is young, given all the evidence, warrants some humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general problem of induction is left aside and the basic validity of inductive reasoning is assumed for the sake of argument; this is obviously contentious in its own right, and orthogonal to this issue. Perhaps all inferential reasoning is suspect, but if so that tells against empirical and instrumental accounts of science as well.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuhn’s discussion of Galileo’s measurements vs. those conducted today is enlightening (see &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn:revolutions:2012"&gt;([1962] 2012)&lt;/span&gt; 119ff). Note, however, that though Galileo’s measurements are not reproducible today, reasons may readily be adduced for the measurements he took from within the context of later theories—the accuracy of the measuring apparatus available to him, for example. Kuhn’s objection is weaker than he thinks.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the idea of embracing realism instrumentally, see above in §2a, and cf. &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rosenberg:philosophy-of-science:2012"&gt;Rosenberg ([2000] 2012)&lt;/span&gt; 211-214.&lt;a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this author’s experience, instrumentalism is far more common among Christians trained in engineering than to those trained in the sciences—perhaps (and this is merely speculation) because the engineering disciplines &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; instrumentalize science. Cf. &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance:reality-scientific-theology:1985"&gt;Torrance (1985)&lt;/span&gt; 22.&lt;a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahner’s Rule famously states that “the ‘economic’ Trinity is the ‘immanent’ Trinity, and the ‘immanent’ Trinity is the ‘economic’ Trinity.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 22)&lt;/span&gt; The dictum has been much debated and stands as a major point of consideration—not to say contention!—in modern Trinitarian doctrinal discussion. This paper will establish that Rahner’s rule, rightly understood and articulated,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is correct and essential for the Christian faith, and leads inexorably to the conclusion that the names “Father,” “Son,” and “Spirit” are titles of God in being, and not only in activity. The triune &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; of God are the result of his triune &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;; therefore, God’s work in salvation history is truly self-revelatory. Thus, Christians may claim to have right and proper, though not exhaustive, knowledge of the divine nature through his mighty works in history. The one true, Triune God has acted in history as the Father of Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Logos, and the Spirit of the Father and the Son—and in this he has not presented a charade, but the Godhead as it truly is. Thus, Christians are right to understand God as being &lt;em&gt;in essence and being&lt;/em&gt;, and not merely in &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;—that is, &lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;—Father, Son, and Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A definition of the terms may be helpful: the “economic” Trinity is the Trinity at work in history (and especially salvation history). The “immanent Trinity” is God present to himself (&lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;); it might well be termed the “ontological” Trinity or “eternal” Trinity.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, Rahner’s claim entails at least 3 sub-claims: God is Trinity in being; God’s Triune nature is revealed &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; through (salvation) history; and God’s Triune nature is &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; revealed through salvation history.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Responses to Rahner’s dictum since its 1970 publication in &lt;em&gt;The Trinity&lt;/em&gt; have taken it in one of two major directions: “radicalizing” and “restricting.” Authors following the radicalizing course reduce the immanent Trinity to the economic trinity. As a consequence, they often tie human knowledge of (and sometimes the actual being of) God to his development along with the cosmos, or to human experience of God in the Incarnation specifically. In constrast, the “restricting” interpreters affirm Rahner’s rule but note its limits. In particular, they tend to emphasize that the being of the Trinity is independent of salvation history, though rightly revealed in it.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="sanders"&gt;(Sanders 2005, 83–84)&lt;/span&gt; This paper takes the later stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="scriptural-basis" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scriptural Basis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several passages in the New Testament emphasize most clearly the integral (and not merely functional) unity and relationship of the Father and the Son, and likewise the essential relationship of Spirit to Father and Son. In each case, the claim’s truth depends on the eternal relations between the persons being precisely those revealed in salvation history.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his prologue, John is at pains to demonstrate that the Logos eternally dwells as Logos and as God—and &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;. In 1:14, John emphasizes that the glory of the Incarnate Word is as (that it: it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;) the glory of the only Son from the Father. He follows this with the assertion that “the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known” (verse 18). In John 10:15, Jesus himself proclaims that he knows the Father and the Father knows him; in 10:30 he declares, “I and the Father are one.” The consistent claim of John’s gospel, then, is: Jesus, the Incarnate Logos, knew and revealed the Father as his Son. For the claim to be coherent or true, two things must hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Jesus’ knowledge of God as his Father could not merely be a statement of the state of affairs between them during the Incarnation. If that were the case, the knowledge he claims would be knowledge not of the Father as he is, but only of the human experience of God as wholly other, transcendent, unreachable—not, that is, of God as immanent. It would not be the knowledge of God as he is within his own triune self. Second, and consequentially, the revelation Jesus offered his disciples of God would likewise be not of God as he is in himself, but only the human experience of God. If God is not Father to the Son and Son to the Father &lt;em&gt;in se&lt;/em&gt;, but only in acts in history, then the revelation of God as the “Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Eph. 1:3, Col. 1:3). Moreover, the apostles claimed Jesus to be “the image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15) in whom “all the fallness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:19); the “radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature” (Heb. 1:3). Again, if Jesus’ acts in history can be separated from his &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, these claims become meaningless. Jesus’ Sonship and his making a way to the Father are central to the apostolic preaching. If Sonship and Fatherhood are not part of God’s nature, Jesus could neither have imaged God nor carried the exact imprint of his nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Jesus’ promise to ask the Father to give the Spirit (14:16–17), which finds its fulfillment after the ascension of the Son, highlights the eternal relation between the persons. Whether during or after (or indeed before) the Incarnation, the Son speaks to the Father &lt;em&gt;as Father&lt;/em&gt;, and the Father sends the Spirit &lt;em&gt;as his Spirit&lt;/em&gt; at the Son’s request &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, in John 14:15–29, Jesus explains that the coming of the Spirit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the coming of the Son. To have the Spirit of truth is to have the Son who is in the Father, in oneself. The Father and the Son come to a believer when the Spirit comes to her (14:20). The Son comes to the one whom the Spirit indwells (14:21, 28). The Spirit proceeds from the Father and bears witness about the Son who sent him (15:26). But as with the persons of the Son and the Father, this identity cannot be if the persons are not merely acting in this way, but rather eternally subsist, eternally are &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; the Father of the Son and Son of the Father and Spirit of the Father and the Son. How could the Spirit bear witness truly to the Son, or rightly be said to be sent by the Father, if the Son and Father are not actually Son and Father, but only act as such in the history of salvation? In that case, the Spirit might be sent in salvation history, but would not bear witness to the Son as he is &lt;em&gt;in himself&lt;/em&gt;. The revelation would be of something less than God—not at all what Jesus promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, it is clear: Scripture claims that the actions of the Triune God in history reveal him as he is. The Son truly reveals the Father. The Father truly sends the Spirit through the Son. The Spirit truly glorifies the Father and the Son. These are so because the Spirit, Son, and Father act in accordance with their eternal, immanent relations. The efficacy of God’s reconciling, saving work—the Son drawing people into his own communion with the Father through the indwelling Spirit—depends on the economy of salvation being the outworking of God’s own nature. Their relations within the Godhead which precede, ground, and perfectly inform their actions. Thus, Rahner’s rule might helpfully be elaborated and rephrased: the economic Trinity (rightly and truly, but inexhaustively) reveals the immanent Trinity, because the economic trinity derives wholly from the being of the immanent Trinity. Being drives action, and action (partially, but truly) reveals being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="rahner-evaluated" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rahner Evaluated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Rahner’s Rule is strictly correct, his own elaboration of these ideas has its limits: not least in its tendency, as he developed it, toward modalism.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, Letham observes that Rahner’s discussion of persons as “distinct manners of subsisting” leaves little room for &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; between the subsisters.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham"&gt;(Letham 2004, 295–96)&lt;/span&gt; However, the solution is not to abandon Rahner’s dictum, but to press on it more firmly, more clearly, and more Scripturally. After all, the Scriptures bear witness to the triune God’s actions precisely as their interacting not merely as “subsistences” but as persons-who-love. The Son does the Father’s will and shows the Father truly, and they send to their people the Spirit who communicates everything of the Father and the Son. As Torrance comments:&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance"&gt;(Torrance [1991] 2006, 53)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when we approach God as Father through the Son, our knowledge of the Father in the Son is grounded in the very being of God and is determined by what he essentially is in his own nature… in Jesus Christ we are really enabled to know God in accordance with his own nature as Father and Son…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case if the economic Trinity and the immanent Trinity are truly distinct. The Incarnation reveals God as he is in himself &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the God’s works flow from his being and essence, in the relations Father, Son, and Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Letham is right that Rahner partially neglects the immanent Trinity and limits himself to the human experience of the economic Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham"&gt;(Letham 2004, 297)&lt;/span&gt; For example, Rahner regularly falls prey to a trap Athanasius avoids: seeing the Father, especially in the Old Testament, primarily as &lt;em&gt;unoriginate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Worse, he derives the person of the Father from the knowledge of the Father.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 60)&lt;/span&gt; He fails to apply the second half of his dictum. If the first half emphasizes that the Trinity’s actions reveal the divine being, the second half emphasizes that those actions flow out of the divine being. The acts of the Godhead in history reveal to God’s nature because they are not merely human experiences, but the God’s self-revelation of his own being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahner largely has the right of this elsewhere. He notes that when Jesus considers himself as Son, he considers not only his human but also his divine relation to the Father as that of a Son.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 63–65)&lt;/span&gt; The incarnate Son reveals both the Father truly, and also that the Incarnate Logos is Son and not Father.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(cf. Rahner [1967] 1997, 29 and &lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance"&gt;@torrance&lt;/span&gt;, 55)&lt;/span&gt; The same must be said of the human relationship to God through the Spirit.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 67)&lt;/span&gt; The Spirit who communicates the love and grace and forgiveness the Father has effected by the work of the Incarnate Son is God. He communicates God as he is, as the &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of the Father’s self-revelation in the Son.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="torrance"&gt;(Torrance [1991] 2006, 203)&lt;/span&gt; The Spirit is the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of the Son; he is the true presence of both; he shares their mutual love and joy, and communicates both to believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Frame objects to another misstep Rahner’s rule might prompt: “There is a difference between what God is necessarily and what he freely chooses to do in his plan for creation.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;(Frame 2002, 2:706–7)&lt;/span&gt; No necessity demanded creation, salvation, or indeed any of God’s acts in history.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham torrance barth:I.2"&gt;(Letham 2004, 363–64; Torrance [1991] 2006; Barth 1956b, I.2:135)&lt;/span&gt; They are &lt;em&gt;gifts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:IV.1"&gt;(Barth 1956a, IV.1:52)&lt;/span&gt; They are acts in which the Trinity is evidenced, and therefore are truly revelatory; but this is because God faithfully acts in accord with his own nature.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham barth:II.1"&gt;(Letham 2004, 296; Barth 1957, II.1:57–58)&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, the realities of the Trinity “either are in God himself… or they exist only in us… as effects of the divine creative activity. But then… there occurs no self-communication, God himself is not there, he is only represented by the creature…”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 100)&lt;/span&gt; God is not obliged to act in a particular way in salvation history, but his actions truly reflect his being. It is because “God is, ‘before’ creation took place, already a being-in-relation”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="gunton"&gt;(Gunton [1991] 1997, 142)&lt;/span&gt; that he is free of necessity in creation or salvation. The Trinity does not need anything, for Father, Son, and Spirit are eternally in relation to one another. God does not need to create, to redeem, even to reveal himself; “God’s self-unveiling remains an act of sovereign divine freedom”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:I.1"&gt;(Barth [1936] 1975, I.1:321)&lt;/span&gt;—but creation, redemption, and revelation are still acts of self-unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, if Rahner’s rule is pressed to the point where God’s triunity is restricted to (or by) his acts in history, it is wrong, for precisely the reason Frame outlines—but it need not be pressed that way. “The Triune God is the Lord of history. Events in this world do not prescribe his being, or his tri-unity… all we know of the immanent Trinity is given in revelation, but revelation does not and cannot fully reveal God to human minds.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="giles"&gt;(Giles 2006, 258)&lt;/span&gt; The Father of Jesus is the eternal Father of the Son, the incarnate Logos the eternal Son of the Father, and the sent Helper is the eternal Spirit of Father and Son. Human knowledge of the Trinity is not &lt;em&gt;exhaustive&lt;/em&gt;, but it is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;. “God reveals himself as he truly is… the economic roles played by the three persons must be appropriate to their natures.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;(Frame 2002, 2:706)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="subordination" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subordination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other serious challenge remains. How (if at all) should Jesus Christ’s human nature be taken to relate to his divine nature in considerations of the correspondence or identity&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the economic and immanent Trinity? The Incarnation reveals the relationship of Father to Son and Son to Father (as well as the relation of the Spirit between the two); then is everything that is true of the way that the Son/Logos-as-man related to the Father true of the way that the Son/Logos eternally relates to the Father? Or are there instead elements of the Incarnation which reflect Jesus’ human as well as his divine nature in relation to the Godhead? It is clear that Jesus the man subordinated his will to God the Father’s will, but it is not at all clear that this entails the eternal submission of the divine Son’s will to the Father’s will. Whether in liberationist theology or attempts to ground male-femlae relations in the ontology of the Trinity, any “radicalizing” approach tends to collapse the proper direction of the identity. It does not follow from the eternal distinction between Father and Son that the Father’s love for the Son is somehow greater than than the reciprocal love of the Son for the Father, or that the creative and redemptive acts of the Trinity in history reflect such a distinction.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="moltmann"&gt;(contra Moltmann 1992, 39)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it necessary in a logical or ontological sense that the Son and not the Father or the Spirit become incarnate? The answer is “yes”, but a carefully qualified yes. Creation, salvation, and eschatological restoration are each acts of the Triune God in which there is no confusion of that which is outside the Trinity and the inner Triune life itself.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:III.1"&gt;(Barth 1958, III.1:54–55)&lt;/span&gt; The Father wills, and through the Son’s action the Spirit effects. But in each of these acts, it is the Father &lt;em&gt;as Father&lt;/em&gt;, the Son &lt;em&gt;as Son&lt;/em&gt;, and the Spirit &lt;em&gt;as Spirit&lt;/em&gt; at work.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:III.1"&gt;(Barth 1958, III.1:56)&lt;/span&gt; Not only in the specific instance of Incarnation, but in all of history&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the economy of the Trinity reflects and proceeds from the essence of the Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="rahner"&gt;(Rahner [1967] 1997, 76)&lt;/span&gt; God freely acts in history in accord with his own being.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="letham rahner frame"&gt;(cf. Letham 2004, 418; Rahner [1967] 1997, 11–12; Frame 2002, 2:711–12)&lt;/span&gt; At the same time, the Incarnation—however climactic—is not the whole of God’s self-revelation. Equally important must be both the rest of salvation history and the apostolic teaching on the nature of the Son, which clarifies: there is &lt;em&gt;mutual&lt;/em&gt; submission within the Trinity.&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="frame"&gt;(Frame 2002, 2:719)&lt;/span&gt; It was fitting that the Son be Incarnate, and the Spirit sent; but more than this in terms of subordination should not be read into the relations of the Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the persons of the Trinity are not Father, Son, and Spirit in and of themselves, then Christians know nothing of the inner life of the God we profess to worship. The notion of Scripture as divine self-revelation is a sham. The actions of God in history do not reveal God himself. In that case, Jesus’ claim to reveal the Father would be more than suspect; it would be false. Moreover, it must have been the Son, the Logos, who was the climactic revelation of God (Heb. 1:3), and the Spirit who is the indwelling presence of Father and Son in God’s people. “The divine Word is the divine speaking. The divine gift is the divine giving.”&lt;span class="citation" data-cites="barth:I.1"&gt;(Barth [1936] 1975, I.1:321)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

T. Wright, Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996, 741 pages. Reviewed by Christopher Krycho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="introduction" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books can claim to represent a substantive entry in both apologetics and hermeneutics, yet this is precisely what N. T. Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Jesus and the Victory of God&lt;/em&gt; accomplishes. In this book, the second in Wright’s massive work on Christians origins,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he treats the question of the historical Jesus via a thorough survey of the modern history of interpretation and the contents of the synoptic gospels themselves. The result is a telling well within historic Christian orthodoxy, though often at sharp angles to current historical approaches to Jesus. Along the way, he also marks out a fruitful interpretive path for Christians reading the gospels. The picture he paints of Jesus—a first-century prophet-Messiah who saw himself standing at the capstone of Israel’s history, fulfilling Yahweh’s plans for his people, but in a way no one in his day seemed to expect—is both apologetically compelling and spiritually illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright begins with an introduction designed to orient the reader to the basic challenges confronting any would-be interpreter of Jesus in the modern era. Critical issues abound, and it is impossible to return to a pre-critical reading of the text. But though the historian must deal with any number of problems in interpreting the person of Jesus, these problems are not specific to him; they are endemic to the task of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright therefore begins by establishing his criteria for evaluating interpretations of Jesus’ person and program. Any such theory must account for the transition from Judaism to Christianity; it must therefore present Jesus, the lynchpin of that transformation, as not only &lt;em&gt;dissimilar&lt;/em&gt; to both worldviews, but also &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to both (132). Jesus must have made sense to his Jewish contemporaries, but also profoundly theologically innovative, to create an entirely new community with its own theology and practice. Wright argues Jesus accomplished this via a program in which “[the] symbolic world of first-century Judaism has been rethought from top to bottom, even while its underlying theology (monotheism, election, and eschatology) has been retained” (218)—with Jesus himself at the center of the plan of Israel’s god, uniquely embodying a father-son relationship with &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues this thesis in two major parts, one focusing on the work and teachings of Jesus as a messianic prophet, the other focusing on the Jesus’ aims and beliefs as he carried out his program. Along the way, Wright examines a wide and representative sample of Jesus’ reported deeds and teachings. In each case, the data fits the thesis: Jesus was retelling Israel’s story in a new way, with himself at the center of God’s plan to end his people’s long exile. By the end of the volume, Wright can thus conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Jesus] believed himself called, by Israel’s god, to &lt;em&gt;evoke&lt;/em&gt; the traditions which promised &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return to Zion, and the somewhat more nebulous but still important traditions which spoke of a human figure sharing the divine throne; to &lt;em&gt;enact&lt;/em&gt; those traditions in his own journey to Jerusalem, his messianic act in the Temple, and his death at the hands of the pagans (in the hope of subsequent vindication); and thereby to &lt;em&gt;embody&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s return. (651)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a simple restatement of typical Christian belief, though of course it accords with it. It goes further, making sense of Jesus’ words and deeds in a way that meets Wright’s criterion of double dissimilarity and double similarity. The thesis passes the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="assessment" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s volume has much to commend it: its historical method, its thoroughness, its broad engagement with opposing views, even its style. Its most significant contributions, though, fall under two basic headings: a challenge to many modern (atheological or even anti-theological) re-readings of the gospels, and a challenge to many current evangelical interpretation of the gospels. Both of these are successful in large measure because of Wright’s care (and flare) in dealing with the material and with other (contrary) treatments of the same data, but it is Wright’s ability to build cogent arguments with that material on this scale which makes this more than a tedious summary of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against secular, demythologizing, and materialist interpretations of the text, Wright mounts a serious and substantive case for a traditional (though not uncritical) assessment of the historical reliability of the synoptics and their picture of Jesus. Many critics suppose that the picture of Jesus painted by the gospellers must be anachronistic, ideologically-driven or situationally-motivated, or inflated by faith in contradistinction to history. Such readings of Jesus paint him as any variety of figures: a sadly-mistaken apocalyptic prophet; a Stoic philosopher in first century garb; a preacher of progressive ideas of love and tolerance; the author of a new, non-Jewish religion; a preacher of Jewish (or timeless) verities. One suspects, with Wright, that many of these readings find their source not in the text but in the prejudices or preferences of the commentators. Wright’s argument, by contrast, is far more credible than any of these—and not simply because it aligns with the historic confession of Jesus as Messiah and Lord. Rather, his picture of a distinctly Jewish apocalyptic prophet makes the best sense of the actual evidence from the earliest texts, including not only the synoptic gospels but also the early epistles and even the non-canonical literature like the Gospel of Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major value of the book is its (usually, but not always, quiet) challenge to many &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; readings of the gospels. Wright accurately notes that many Christian interpreters, perhaps especially in the Protestant tradition, have struggled to make sense of the gospels. Many evangelical readings of the gospels find little or no connection between what Jesus said and did and his crucifixion and resurrection. Indeed, no few of the commentaries this author has read sturggle to make much of the Pharisees’ and Sadducees’ mutual hostility toward Jesus without reducing them to caricatures, or to make sense of many of the parables or their role in Jesus’ ministry. The interpretation Wright proposes accounts for all these issues, and provides a helpful hermeneutic for untangling many of the otherwise perplexing passages in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work thus walks a helpful middle ground between misinterpretations on either side. Anachronistic tendencies among both secular and Christians interpreters lead both astray. He was not a modern progressive, nor an unfortunately mistaken apocalyptic street preacher, nor a teller of timeless ethical truths, nor a preacher of a new religion of grace oddly disconnected from Judaism. Rather, he was a Jewish prophet going about the business of offering a subversive interpretation—though one deeply in touch with the Law and Prophets—of &lt;span class="divine-name tetragrammaton"&gt;YHWH&lt;/span&gt;’s promises to his. This is unsurprising. After all, this is precisely how the gospels present Jesus: dissimilar in certain ways from both the Judaism that preceded him and the Christianity that followed him (again: Wright’s criteria of double dissimilarity). Any telling of the historical Jesus must provide an explanation for the transition from Second Temple Judaism to Christianity, and do so on historically plausible grounds. So must any right interpretation of the gospels for Christian piety. Wright’s theory accomplishes this handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more important is the way in which Wright’s work strikes at a kind of nascent docetism among many Christians. While Jesus’ full humanity may be an article of faith for orthodox believers, many fail to think of what exactly that means. Jesus was not merely as a divine mystery speaking timeless truths and then fulfilling a cruciform commission strangely disconnected from his parable-telling, paralytic-healing ministry. Rather, he was a &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; standing at the conclusion the line of Jewish men who had called Israel back to faithfulness and proclaimed that Israel’s God was about saving the whole world. Not only does Wright have a Chalcedonian Christology, he is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; orthodox than many believers: the Jesus painted in this portrait is no less human than divine. Jesus’ sense of vocation, his real temptations and struggles to fulfill that vocation, and even his not-rare, but unconventionally-embodied, claim to Messiahship were the actions of a first-century Jewish &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;. To see this clearly is to see exactly what the Fathers meant in their confession of “our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and manhood, truly God and truly man… consubstantial with us according to the Manhood, in all things like unto us, without sin…”&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To miss it is to risk missing the humanity of Christ in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application-and-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application and Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright’s work is to be commended on a number of levels. Its scholarly depth makes it a formidable resource when discussing the historical Jesus, particularly with those who reject the gospels’ claims to present Jesus accurately. Wright’s enjoyable wit makes the length of the work far more manageable. His proposed hermeneutic, though it can be pressed too far, provides a helpful tool for interpreting the synoptics. Most of all, his reminder of the real and true humanity of Jesus is a sharp rejoinder to the functional docetism all too common in evangelicalism. The book is therefore very helpful for both apologetics and exegesis. Whatever their other differences with Wright, pastors and teachers would do well to digest Wright’s work here.&lt;/p&gt;

Azurdia III spent several decades preaching and pastoring. He was thus well-experienced in the week-to-week work of preparing sermons and the burden of caring for a congregation. During his years of pastoral work, however, he also studied at Westminster Theological Seminary; he was at the time of the book’s publication a professor at Western Seminary. Thus, he also brought to the table academic knowledge helpful for situating his developing understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in a preaching ministry. Accordingly, Azurdia brings both Scripture and experience to bear in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt;: the lessons he learned in seminary, he then applied in the context of his ongoing ministry, and was able to filter his experience through careful reflection on the Scriptures. &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; was published not at the beginning of that career, but after considerable time behind the pulpit of an ordinary church, after he had moved into a teaching role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia’s aim in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Empowered Preaching&lt;/em&gt; is twofold: to demonstrate the necessity of the Holy Spirit’s work in the preacher for effective preaching, and to describe how the preacher should go about seeking the Spirit’s work in his preaching. He argues in his introduction that “the greatest deficiency in contemporary expositional ministry is powerlessness; in other words, preaching that is devoid of the vitality of the Holy Spirit” (12). That is, although right preaching necessarily entails careful exegesis and attention to the “literal, grammatical, historical, contextual, redemptive” details of a text (11), no amount of mere intellectual study on its own will accomplish God’s purposes for preaching. If the church is to be encouraged, challenged, and built up; and if outsiders are to be convicted, the Holy Spirit must be present and working efficaciously through the preacher. Only the Spirit can change human hearts. This was true for the early church, and it is true today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azurdia lays out his thesis in a brief introduction. Following that, he does not simply repeat the thesis chapter by chapter, however. Instead, he builds a broader theology of preaching and connects the different elements of the preaching ministry back to the central theme of the text. Thus, in Chapter 1, he starts by arguing that the “greater works” the disciples would do were the advancement of the gospel through the nations, and notes how Christ explicitly tied this to the coming of the promised Holy Spirit. The advance of the gospel was for the disciples, and is for modern preachers, utterly dependent on the work of God. Chapter 2 describes who the Spirit is and what he does in the life of the minister—and what goes wrong in the ministry when the Spirit is neglected. In Chapter 3, Azurdia argues for Christocentric preaching, since the Spirit is &lt;em&gt;Christ’s&lt;/em&gt; Spirit and glorifies him. Chapter 4 carries this theme further: the priority of every preacher must be glorifying Christ, not merely meeting the felt needs of the people. Every topic must be heard in light of the finished work of the Savior, not standing on its own as abstract ethical instruction. In Chapter 5, he argues that the first responsibility of both the minister and the church is preaching—and that, as such, the church should understand when the pastor spends most of his time preparing for sermon delivery, rather than on other concerns. Here he also takes time to critique ministry methodologies which do not align with the gospel, especially those in many seeker-sensitive churches which have run to extremes of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 6, Azurdia comes to the core of his message: the preacher must be both generally filled with the Spirit (i.e. regenerate) and specifically filled time and again by the Spirit for preaching. Here he draws upon the frequent language of being “filled with the Holy Spirit” in Acts as well as the affirmations of preachers like Martyn Lloyd Jones. Chapter 7 is an examination of the flip-side of the necessity of the Spirit’s filling: the frustration of the pastor’s own inability. If the work of the Spirit is utterly essential for preaching to have any effect whatsoever, then all the pastor’s efforts may be for naught. This may lead to either despair (for the self-dependent man) or greater faith (for the man who trusts Christ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 8, Azurdia turns to the nature and life of a man called to this ministry: he “&lt;em&gt;must devote himself to a consistent pattern of fervent intercession&lt;/em&gt;” (135, emphasis original). That the Spirit must be present for preaching to be effective is not grounds for pastors to abdicate their own responsibility. Rather, it increases their responsibility to pray for the Spirit to work through their preaching. Chapter 9 continues this focus on the life of the preacher. He must be prayerful, diligent in study, and prayerful in his study. He must remember in all this prayer that the Spirit is not a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; but a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, someone who can be grieved. The preacher must keep himself holy, and so must his congregation—because either may drive away the Spirit by their unrepentance. Chapter 10 illustrates and emphasizes this necessity of prayer in the life of both preacher and congregation. Finally, Azurdia briefly summarizes his argument: “&lt;em&gt;Spirit empowered preaching is the principle means of advancing the kingdom of God…. will be evangelical in emphasis…. is the responsibility of the church&lt;/em&gt;” (179–181, emphasis original).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is persuasive and thorough, but neither as effective or as persuasive as it might have been. Azurdia’s comments on the “greater ministry” the disciples were to have are perhaps the most helpful material in the book. In general, his attention to the roles the Spirit plays in the life of the church is a helpful corrective both to the neglect the Spirit often receives from non-charismatic churches and the misinterpretations proffered by many in the charismatic movement. Likewise, his call to prayerful as well as well-studied preaching is a helpful reminder especially for preachers tempted to rely on their own intellectual merits. Gladly, and unlike E. M. Bounds’ work on prayer, he does so without ever denigrating the value of intellectual engagement and deep study. Azurdia’s counsel to study hard, pray hard, and pray during the time of study is well-taken. Those who preach should devote meaningful parts of their preparation time not only to exegesis but to fellowship with God by &lt;em&gt;prayerful&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Azurdia’s emphasis on the nature and person of the Spirit. As noted above, he refuses to indulge in the mistaken charismatic emphases on the miraculous gifts over the more central work of the Spirit: revealing Christ. All the focus on sign gifts can quickly lead people to forget that the Spirit was sent to make Christ known and glorify him. His diagnostic question is extremely helpful (and not only for evaluating charismatics, but for evaluating anyone claiming God’s hand on his ministry): “&lt;em&gt;Does this ministry reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/em&gt;” (50, emphasis original). Again, the Spirit is the spirit of truth, sent by the Father to empower the church to know and make known the Son. As such, no ministry which claims the Spirit’s power but focuses on anything other than knowing and proclaiming Christ is legitimate. At the same time, this does not mean the church should shun the Spirit to avoid those missteps—rather, the church should point to a better understanding of the Spirit’s mission, and respond in faith. A church that understands the Spirit’s proclamatory and instructing role will follow Azurdia’s counsel and dedicate itself to prayer, cognizant that apart from the Spirit the church and her pastor can do nothing. Congregations should also learn to ask that same question of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sermons and preachers and experiences: does it reveal and glorify Jesus Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, weaknesses emerge in a number of areas which substantially lessen the book’s impact. First, Azurdia makes the same move many Reformed and evangelical preachers do, elevating the preaching of the word to the primary (and nearly the sole) responsibility of the preacher. This move seems unwarranted in light of the distinction between ordinary pastors and the apostles on whose actions (in Acts 6) the view is grounded. As such, Azurdia simply passed over the many other responsibilities enjoined of shepherds in the pastoral epistles. To be sure, preaching is a necessity in the life of the church. However, it is only one of the pastor’s responsibilities, and he will find it difficult to carry it out effectively if he is not sharing life with his sheep. Thus, pastors ought to dedicate much of their time to &lt;em&gt;shepherding&lt;/em&gt;: to caring for the ordinary soulish needs of their people and not only for the times of preaching. This is doctrinally necessary, and practically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More problematic was Azurdia’s conflation of the Spirit’s filling with an experience or sense of that filling. Like Lloyd-Jones and others he cites, Azurdia describes the anointing or unction of the Spirit as a particular sense the preacher and congregation have of the Spirit’s working through him in a unique way. Curiously, Azurdia also affirms that there may be times the Spirit is moving powerfully but the preacher is unaware of it, as in the common case of a man who preached and felt it accomplished nothing but heard later from members of his congregation how the Spirit used it in their lives. Too often in evangelicalism, &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; is mistaken for &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;. Nowhere in the New Testament is the Spirit’s presence described in terms of a feeling in the preacher. Rather, it is born out by the effects of the preaching. To be sure, the Spirit may graciously grant the pastor a clear sense of his presence and power on some days, and that sense is a blessing. However, the absence of such a sense does not indicate the Spirit’s absence; neither does a strong feeling necessarily indicate his presence in power. In encouraging pastors to think in these terms, Azurdia ultimately plants seeds of discouragement in the lives of those who may preach diligently and prayerfully—and effectively—for many years without that particular experience, which is promised no one. As he notes of many experiences in charismatic circles, “we need to be concerned that the spiritual development of well-meaning Christians can become vulnerable to the law of diminishing returns… Often, the inevitable consequence is spiritual emptiness” (49). This is no less a danger for the preacher expecting a strong internal sense of anointing than for the believer wanting a fresh anointing for speaking in tongues. Preachers should indeed dedicate themselves to prayer and come with an expectation that they can accomplish nothing on their own, but they should reject as unbiblical and unhelpful the idea that their internal sense of the Spirit’s presence is accurate or indicative of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, on the whole, Azurdia’s point is well-taken. The church desperately needs the Holy Spirit for her efficacy in ministry. Lives will not change unless God works: sermons will fall on deaf ears, and congregations’ ministries may produce physically helpful outcomes while leaving sinners damned. Preachers and their people must recover prayerful dependence on the third person of the Trinity. They must ask constantly of their ministries, “Does this show Christ clearly and make him look glorious?” They must plead for the Spirit to come and work. But (contra Azurdia) they must never mistake their perceived experience of the Spirit for the actual work of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few books are as perplexing to modern readers as Revelation, and few matters within it as controversial as the nature of the millennium. As one commentator put it, “Judging from the amount of attention given by many writers to the first ten verses of chapter 20, one would think they were the single most important section of the book of Revelation.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The three major millennial readings—pre-, a-, and postmillennial—divide on how to read the sequence. Both amillennial and postmillennial interpretations affirm that Christ will return at the end of the millennium and that there will be a single resurrection, whereas the premillennial interpretation anticipates Christ returning to &lt;em&gt;inaugurate&lt;/em&gt; the millennium, raising (some or all of) the saints at that time and then raising all who remain at the end of the millennium for final judgment. This paper will argue that John did not in fact intend to establish a totally new doctrine of a millennium (of any sort) in this much-debated sequence, but rather intended to succor his audience with the hope of God’s faithfulness to his promises. That is: the millennial passage indicates not a duration of time—not even an indeterminate sequence as in some idealist or historicist readings—but rather depicts symbolically and numerologically the fulfillment of the promises made to the saints elsewhere in Revelation and the rest of Scripture. In particular, he draws on imagery and the recapitulatory pattern established in Ezekiel 37–48,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presenting the same conflict multiple times from different angles to emphasize the sovereignty of God and the surety of his salvation and vindication of his saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation was most likely written by John the Apostle from exile on the island of Patmos in the early-to-mid-90s A.D., though it is impossible to be certain of either authorship or provenance.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The churches which constituted John’s audience—the seven addressees of the letters that opened the book—were facing a history of persecution and the threat of future persecution. As early as the 60s A.D., the church had faced serious persecution under Nero, and it continued to face varying degrees of opposition in the years that followed. The book served then—and has served the church ever since—as an exhortation to endure and an encouragement that whatever trials come, God will accomplish justice in the end and vindicate his saints.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the purpose of the book is thus relatively clear, it remains difficult to interpret because of outstanding questions regarding its genre and structure. The book opens and closes in epistolary fashion; it declares itself to be a prophecy; and it is explicitly titled an apocalypse and bears all the hallmarks of the genre.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with many apocalypses, and like the Old Testament prophecies on which it is modeled and from which it draws, the book functions not merely as revelation, but also (and perhaps primarily) as exhortation—thus the epistolary frame and the consistent thematic warning against idolatry.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As with apocalyptic literature in general, the book is heavy on imagery, metaphor, and symbolic representations. As such, it conveys its message at the three distinct levels of &lt;em&gt;visionary&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;historical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;referential&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;symbolic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Leaping directly from the visionary to the referential level without considering the symbolic meanings will certainly lead to misinterpretation within the genre. Indeed, the book itself indicates that it conveys its message primarily through symbols.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, right interpretation of the text must respect literary convention and take care not to leap from the content of John’s vision to a proposed referent without considering how symbolism may be at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The millennial passage does not stand alone, but is part of the final, conclusive judgment cycle, beginning in 19:11 and concluding at the end of chapter 20. The sequence is comprised of five “And I saw…”&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sequences, which begin in 19:11, 19:17, 20:1, 20:4, and 20:11. The millennium itself is introduced in 20:2–3 and discussion of the millennium carries on through the final defeat of Satan after his release “when the thousand years are ended” (20:7).&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After God’s final crushing victory over Satan, the scene turns to eternal judgment at the great white throne. Throughout the entire final sequence, he draws heavily on the narrative, language, and imagery of Ezekiel 37–48. Thus, John’s cycle of judgment passages leads directly into a discussion of the new Jerusalem, just as Ezekiel’s judgment sequence leads into his lengthy treatment of the future, eschatological temple.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finally, John synthesizes these images from both Ezekiel with eschatological language from Isaiah, combining the two great visions into a unified whole. This pattern, and the imagery layered throughout, should both caution the reader from interpreting the sequence in strict chronological fashion—Ezekiel’s treatment is expressly recapitulatory&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and suggest that John’s intent may be comment and synthesis rather than the formulation of a wholly new doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-the-beast-and-the-false-prophet" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:11–21: A Climactic Battle with the Beast and the False Prophet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John opens this final section of the book with two visions. The first (19:11–16) is an image of Christ as the divine warrior, the Word of God, whose word destroys the enemies of God. The second (19:17–21) is of the defeat of those enemies and a horrifying feast—the dreadful inverse of the wedding supper of the Lamb.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is the first of several significant clues that the millennial passage that follows &lt;em&gt;recapitulates&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;follows&lt;/em&gt; this battle. Throughout the book, with the sole exception of the appearance of nations in glory in the conclusion, “the nations” (τὰ ἐθνῆ) appear to the rebellious nations in contrast with the saints&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and the nations are &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; destroyed here. The beast and false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire (19:20), and “the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse” (19:21). The deceived nations that join Satan in Satan in his post-millennial war must be understood in light of this destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-millenniumsatan-bound-saints-reigning-with-christ" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:1–6: The Millennium—Satan Bound, Saints Reigning with Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 20:1–3, John describes an angel binding Satan and locking him in an abyss for a thousand years. In vv. 4–6, he describes the “first resurrection” and the thousand-year reign of the martyrs-and-saints with Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the one hand, the language used here for binding Satan seems fairly strong: the angel binds him, then shuts him in the Abyss and seals and locks it.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On the other hand, this is not the first place where the New Testament speaks of Satan’s being bound (cf. especially Mark 3:27 and the parallel in Matt. 12:29, Luke 19:17–18, John 12:31, Col. 2:15).&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nor is it the first place where angelic forces defeat Satan and restrain his power (cf. Rev. 12).&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The angel binds Satan, and the point seems to be the &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;efficacy&lt;/em&gt; rather than the &lt;em&gt;extent&lt;/em&gt; of the binding: to prevent Satan from deceiving the nations and from assaulting the saints, until the climactic final battle.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It also establishes God’s rule: Satan is powerless to resist.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After describing Satan’s binding, John turns his attention (another “and I saw”) to saints sharing in the first resurrection. Notably, these saints are seated on thrones, and John has used the language of martyr-saints and thrones before (see 6:9ff).&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The word “throne” appears some forty-seven times in the book, and apart from references to Satan’s or the beast’s rule, all of them (save perhaps these) unambiguously refer to heaven, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; earth.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The link strongly suggests that the scene is not the earth in some future age, but heaven, and reinforces the notion that John is recapitulating material he has covered before, rather than continuing sequentially from what preceded in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s language of the “first resurrection” (20:6) and the ingressive use of preterite ζάω, “They came to life…” and “the rest… did not come to life” (20:4–5) are perhaps the strongest arguments in favor of a premillennial reading of the passage. The language suggests bodily resurrection, and indeed it is unusual for the same word to be used first of spiritual and then of physical resurrection only a few phrases apart.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, there are reasons within the text itself to think this is not John’s point. The first resurrection here includes all of, but only, the righteous; and the second all of, but only, the unrighteous.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Similarly, and more conclusively, the &lt;em&gt;second death&lt;/em&gt; that parallels the (implied but never mentioned!) second resurrection&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is at least primarily spiritual, while the first is clearly physical; it is therefore possible the inverse is true of the resurrections.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The kind of “coming to life” on display here is thus not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; final resurrection, but spiritual life in the interval between Christ’s comings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the literary tenor of the passage warrants caution beyond even that already suggested by the apocalyptic setting. The passage is saturated in symbolism and imagery: “chain,” “key,” “Abyss,” “dragon,” “ancient serpent,” “locked,” and “sealed” are all certainly images representing realities, rather than literal depictions of those realities.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Given ten’s association with completeness or perfection, the use of its third power is clearly symbolic as well.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, John here draws on imagery that was already prevalent in the apocalyptic literature that formed the context of his audience’s expectation. The notion of a Messianic millennium was not his invention, though he did bring it to bear in a unique context within the Christian canon.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To suggest, then, that these “thousand years” &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be taken as a literal depiction of time, regardless of how often John repeats it, is to mistake the literary context and John’s intended meaning.&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; the numbers in Revelation appear to have a figurative rather than literal referent.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed, any directly literal approach to the millennium is necessarily “an incredible way to treat numbers in an apocalypse!”&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, a symbolic reading of the thousand years seems best—and not only in the sense that the time period in view is not literally one thousand years, but also in the sense that it points to something other than a physical reign of the martyr-saints on earth entirely. One of the functions of the millennium, on any reading, is to demonstrate both Satan’s and the nations’ lack of repentance. Neither does a thousand years of being restrained chasten Satan whatsoever, nor does that interval where Satan is restrained change the hearts of rebellious men and women.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Both Satan and rebellious humanity vindicate God’s judgment against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-climactic-battle-with-satan" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;20:7–10: A Climactic Battle with Satan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not itself a distinct section,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the final war with Satan recapitulates material already covered in Revelation 16–19, and also links back to both of the immediately preceding “and I saw” sections.&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Here is one of the major clues that John is not building a theology of the millennium: the climactic defeat of Satan here directly echoes the previous defeat at Armageddon (16:14) and the defeat of the beast and false prophet (see above).&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Indeed “the war” (ὁ πόλεμος) appears only here, at 16:14, and 19:19 in the book, further tying them together.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As noted above, the nations were utterly destroyed in the battle in 19:17–21, yet appear again here as Satan’s pawns only to be destroyed completely again. Even commentators who suppose a basically premillennial outlook therefore grant that the sequence of events with the nations here is difficult to make chronological sense of in premillennial terms.&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is the same battle, with the same enemies, and the same outcome. John is indeed following Ezekiel’s outline; like the prophet, he retells the same battle from two angles. Just as the beast and false prophet deceived the nations and led them to destruction, Satan deceives the nations only to lead them to destruction. Indeed, this serves as the conclusion to a large-scale chiasm running from the beginning of ch. 12. John introduces Satan, the beast and the false prophet, and Babylon, and in turn God judges Babylon, the beast and the false prophet, and finally Satan.&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome is as expected, in light of the rest of the book and especially the preceding section it so clearly echoes. There, Christ defeated the Beast and the false prophet utterly; here God defeats Satan utterly. No actual battle appears in either case: God’s and Christ’s victory is immediate and without contest.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Satan’s deception comes to an end once and for all, every one of his tools (whether the harlot, the false prophet and the beast, or the rebellious nations of the earth) unable to stand before God.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As in Ezekiel, the rebellious nations are destroyed in the first telling with a sword, in the second telling with fire.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Likewise, the end of Satan’s deceptions of the nations culminates in his being thrown into the lake of fire, just as were the other deceivers in ch. 19.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The millennium is not a sequence &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; the war against the saints, but a second image of the time that &lt;em&gt;leads up to&lt;/em&gt; that final confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="after-judgment-then-consummation" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;After: Judgment, Then Consummation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Satan’s defeat, the living and the dead are judged, and those whose names are not found in the book of life are subjected to the second death—this one spiritual, joining the beast, the false prophet, and Satan in the lake of fire. Notably, the dead who are judged have not gone previously to the lake of fire here—unlike the rest of the New Testament’s expectation that the dead will be judged immediately at Christ’s return.&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the last, Death and Hades join them (just as in 1 Cor. 15:26).&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: these are symbolic images; the visionary content cannot be translated into future-historical referents directly and without interpretation. These conclusive events &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; help resolve the point of the millennium itself, though: they align all the final judgments together, synchronize John’s telling with the Ezekiel narration he is interpreting. Thus, John turns immediately after the judgment to the final vision of the book: the New Jerusalem, and the new Heavens and new Earth, and the descent of God to dwell with humanity forever. As in Ezekiel, the focus is on the shape of the future temple, as a symbol of the perfect restoration of God’s place of fellowship with humanity—only magnified manifold even beyond Ezekiel’s vision. Further, John’s integration of Isaianic imagery here into the new Jerusalem/heaven and earth strongly militates against interpreting Isaiah 65 as pointing to a millennial age.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to this massively perfect garden-city-temple emphasizes the finality of God’s eschatological work. It also further demonstrates that John’s concern, unlike so many commentators, was not the establishment of a doctrine of a millennium. Rather, John sought to make clear that God’s victory would be final and complete, that justice would be done in the world, and that the saints would have the reward he promised them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="concern" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may err—indeed, &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; erred—in several ways in its interpretation of the Apocalypse. One the one hand, she may swerve into the kind of sensuousness attributed to Papias and others early in the history of the church, prompting Origin and Augustine to take a purely spiritual reading of the millennium, with the Reformers following them. On the other hand, the church has sometimes carried this idealized reading into spiritualizing away Christ’s return. Neither of these are good. John’s millennium is not a literal thousand years, nor even an unspecified-but-lengthy period of time when the former saints reign in resurrected bodies on a still-fallen earth, with sin yet-unjudged, over others who are still mortal and can reject salvation.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But it is not a throwaway idea, and it should not lead the church to mischaracterize &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; elements of John’s eschatology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John uses this language not to outline a new eschatological doctrine, but to shine light on an old one: God’s work overthrowing the powers of the present age in his Messiah’s incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. He reiterates what he and others have already said: Satan’s power to deceive the nations has been broken, because the strong man came and bound him.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christ is reigning &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; (Hebrews 1:3–4), though there is a greater reign yet to come. Moreover, the broader context of the book makes clear that John’s point here is not to suggest some future half-way stop between fall and glory. Rather, he assures saints that even now, Satan’s hatred and lies are restrained—however fierce they may seem at times. As such, the saints can stand fast in the face of whatever trials they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major implications of this reading for the life of the church. First, and foundational for the second, Revelation as a book and this passage specifically have something to say to the church &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. These are not merely vague notions about an unknown future, which confuse rather than comfort. Instead, they are a symbolic (but for that no less &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;) proclamation of the reign of Jesus Christ, the Ancient of Days, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords who will one day let Satan loose only to destroy him and his evil utterly. Secondly, therefore, the church should &lt;em&gt;preach&lt;/em&gt; this book, and regularly. John’s promises about the future will lead the church now to stand fast when the surrounding world calls for compromise and the temptation to idolatry rears its head, as it does in every generation. Satan is bound; Christ reigns &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, and the saints with him; and someday Christ will come again, judge the living and the dead once for all, and consummate his kingdom. “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus” (Rev. 14:12). The indicative—Christ reigns, Satan is bound—prompts an imperative: life as if this is so!&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Come temptations to materialism, or the worship of ancestors, or nationalism, or any other idolatry, Christians proclaim Christ alone is Lord. —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identity of the martyrs/saints is primarily significant for premillennial readings.

While this division is tragic, it does rightly reflect the importance of the issue, reflecting as it does on central issues including a church’s or denomination’s Christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology. It is both important enough to divide over, and central enough to warrant ongoing effort to reconcile over. However, to either rightly divide or rightly reunite, believers must have a clear understanding of the issues at stake in the discussion, as well as the Biblical, theological, reasonable, and traditional bases for those reasons.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three major questions confront the church regarding the Lord’s Supper: &lt;em&gt;What is it?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Who may administer it?&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Who may receive it?&lt;/em&gt; The first question is a matter of Christology and sacramentology; the second and third questions are ecclesiological, but depend on the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="christology-and-sacramentology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christology and sacramentology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic Catholic view, &lt;em&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/em&gt; is the idea that in the Lord’s Supper, the body and blood of Christ become truly, physically present in the elements—not in their physical makeup, but in their ontological reality.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Protestants have frequently characterized this view as a &lt;em&gt;re-sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; of Christ, in which the priest sacrifices Christ again. The actual Roman Catholic view is not a &lt;em&gt;re-offering of Christ&lt;/em&gt;, however, but a &lt;em&gt;re-presentation of Christ’s offering&lt;/em&gt;. Put another way, when the priest offers the sacrament, the congregation mystically participates in the once-for-all action that Christ accomplished at the cross in time and space.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Granting that the Protestant characterization accurately reflects popular Catholic piety regarding the Mass—but just as Protestants would not wish to be judged on the worst excesses of their own traditions’ popular piety, so they should interact with the best of Catholic thought and not only its worst extremes.) Catholics further believe that God provides grace to aid the believer in life and to save from the power of sin by taking the mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lutheran concept of the Table is different from the Catholic position, but nearer it than most other Protestant views. Luther rejected many elements of Roman Catholic &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of the mass, along with the Catholic doctrines of transubstantiation and re-presentation.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, he insisted that Christ’s body and blood were nonetheless physically present in the bread and wine. In support of this view, he leaned heavily on the language of the words of institution, “This is my body… this is my blood…” The simple declaration he took to be a clear indication of &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;signified&lt;/em&gt; (as Zwingli argued in their debates). That is: “the body and blood of Christ are received through the acts of eating and drink… the consecrated bread &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his body and the consecrated wine &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; his blood.”&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Many) Lutherans are thus inclined to take the Reformed view (see below) as of an “&lt;em&gt;unreal, fictitious&lt;/em&gt; presence” in contrast with a real, “&lt;em&gt;corporeal&lt;/em&gt; presence.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variations in the Reformed tradition, most prominently Zwingli’s memorial view and Calvin’s “real” or “spiritual” presence view. Of these, Calvin’s is the most distinctive and the most widely practiced apart from Zwingli’s view, and is the dominant view among orthodox/Westminster Presbyterians. Calvin argued that Supper is a gift from God the Father, which points to Jesus Christ, as the Holy Spirit makes Christ really present to believers.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He took the words of institution to indicate that Jesus really is present with believers in the feast—“the incarnate, risen and ascended Jesus Christ along with the grace that God promises.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; For Calvin and his successors, the bread and wine are really bread and wine, and these untransformed elements are themselves part of God’s gift.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, this view takes the words of institution as more than mere sign-language; it affirms that through the Spirit believers are truly partaking of Christ himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the dominant view among Western evangelicals is that the Supper is symbolic or memorial only. First articulated by Zwingli and championed by the Anabaptists and Baptists in the centuries that followed, this approach has its adherents among nearly all present-day free-church denominations and non-denominational churches, including the majority of Baptists and charismatics (of all “waves”). There is no single view among Baptists or other low-church evangelicals (Pentecostals or other charismatics included), since they have no single binding authority, whether ecclesiastical or confessional.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nonetheless, some standard contours do emerge: baptist theologians tend to emphasize that the grace of God is specially present, but only in the same ways it is specially present in preaching, fellowship, or other normal means of grace. On the other hand, common piety regards the supper as purely symbolic, having no gracious content whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Popular views among charismatics may modify this somewhat, however, by including the idea of healing at the Table, as an act of the Spirit for the gathered church.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ecclesiological-practice" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ecclesiological Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all major traditions partake of the Lord’s Supper as gathered churches—not in individual or family settings (though there are of course exceptions). While some denominations and organizations also practice the Eucharist in parachurch contexts, this is the exception rather than the rule.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Catholic church offers the Mass daily: as the supreme sacrament and primary means of grace in the life of a Catholic believer, it must be taken frequently. Lutherans, most Reformed churches, Anglicans, and Methodists generally take the Supper weekly, usually as the climax of the Sunday service. By contrast, most other low-church evangelicals—whether denominationally affiliated or not, and whether charismatic or not—come to the table much less frequently. There is no typical pattern among such groups. Taking the supper as rarely as once or twice a year is not unheard-of, taking it weekly is rare, and monthly or quarterly perhaps the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various demoninations’ restrictions on the Table vary significantly. The Catholic and Orthodox generally restrict the Table to those in communion with their traditions. Some (though by no means all) Lutherans and Reformed similarly bar from the Supper those who do not share their particular confessional stances.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Among the free church traditions, practices vary widely. On the one hand, many modern baptistic churches practice fully open communion&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—a practice that has deep roots in the tradition, dating at least to the practice of John Newton’s church. On the other hand, the majority of Baptists historically and many today argue for closed communion, where only believers baptized &lt;em&gt;as believers&lt;/em&gt; (and usually by immersion) may take communion.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Across all traditions, advocates of more “open” communion emphasize that it is a universal church institution that emphasizes Christ’s work on behalf of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; believers, while those in favor of “closed” communion emphasize the importance of the elements that do separate the denominations—not least their Christology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="spiritual-presence-practiced-regularly" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spiritual Presence, Practiced Regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions are commendable for their attentiveness to the words of institution, there remain substantial problems with both their views. The Roman Catholic emphasis on priestly mediation of the mass obscures Christ’s all-sufficiency as mediator; likewise, the language of re-presentation of Christ’s sacrifice obscures the finality of Christ’s act on the cross. The Lutheran view recognizes no distinction whatsoever between sign and thing signified, and it hangs on the interpretation of the crucial “is” in the words of institution, ironically without regard for how language (sign) may convey something other than than bare sense (signified). Meanwhile, purely symbolic/memorial views fail to give due attention to either the seriousness of Christ’s words at institution or the ways in which God has always mediated his grace through physical signs and symbols. The language of both Old and New Testament ordinances is more than merely figurative: God really did something in the sacrifice of sheep and goats, and he really does something in baptism, church discipline, and the Eucharist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin’s “real presence” view seems the best of the options. It maintains the immensity of Christ’s proclamation of his presence, but without insisting on a view of that presence that diminishes his corporeal ascension. It maintains a truly sacramental view of the material elements, thereby claiming the goodness of the created order and God’s right to use his created world in particular and spiritual ways, but without embracing an &lt;em&gt;ex opere operato&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of his grace along the way. Finally, it both maintains the actual presence of Christ himself and is beautifully Trinitarian, understanding that presence as effected by the Spirit, who both catches the believer up to heaven and mediates the Savior to his people in their fellowship, as believers partake of the free gift of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper is a demonstration of the unity of Christ’s people, and as such it should be extended as widely as possible. On the one hand, it is important to offer the Supper only to those who are professing believers in Christ. On the other, refusing communion to those who worship the Trinitarian God in the risen Lord Jesus proclaims division in the very practice meant to display the church’s unity. Against the practice of “closed” communion, churches should welcome to the table any who trust in Christ. “It is a meal of remembrance for Jesus’ sacrifice that brought us forgiveness from sins. As such it is solely a meal for disciples…. Therefore our communion is open to all who profess to be followers and disciples of Christ.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to frequency, Scripture is silent, and so it behooves Christians today not to press any position too strongly. Yet it still seems fair to say that if indeed the ordinance is a place of special meeting between Christ and his people, then his people should be eager to meet with him often. In that light, weekly communion seems best. However, this does not necessarily entail partaking of the Table in every service (though it may). Churches might also opt to leave it at its current monthly or quarterly frequency for corporate gatherings, but make it a part of the weekly gathering of small groups, for example, thus emphasizing both the broader community of the church and the particular unity of the communities within it.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many believers are tempted to dismiss these sorts of details as of little importance—secondary issues that do not or should not affect them or the life of their church. However, because the church’s practice of the Lord’s Supper has implications in so much of the church’s life, her doctrine and practice at the Table are in fact quite important. Rightly understood and practiced, the Table teaches the church about Christology, the communion of the saints, the work of the Spirit, the goodness of the created order, and the relationship between Christ’s work and God’s grace. These are not light matters; they are foundational in the life of the church. The high-church traditions certainly have this much right, then: the liturgies and practices of the church matter. Indeed, in many ways, the &lt;em&gt;practices&lt;/em&gt; of a community may be as profound a force in shaping her people as the &lt;em&gt;proclamations&lt;/em&gt; of her leaders.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any Christian community with deficient views or practices of communion will &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; be lacking in its worship and fellowship. Christians are called to unity, and it is around the table that their unity is most deeply proclaimed. If there is any place for ecumenism among Christian denominations, it is at the Table. Likewise, Christians are called to worship not just Christ-the-idea, but Christ-the-man, whose body and blood they spiritually receive for the nourishment of their souls: the good gift of the Father, worked in them by the Spirit. Christ the Lord is seated in heaven, and is spiritually present everywhere, but he is spiritually present &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; at the Table,&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and this is a great comfort to saints in the midst of trials and woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay will demonstrate that the concluding section of Lamentations 3, running from v. 40 to v. 66, constitutes an open-ended, multivocal answer to the question posed in Lamentations 3:39: “Why should a person complain, / a living man concerning his sins?” The poet did not believe Yahweh demanded silence of his people, even in the face of his judgment. Rather, his people were to trust him deeply enough to call out to him, even when all evidence suggested he would not answer. The point will be demonstrated by a close analysis of the structure, verbs, and poetic devices employed throughout the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="authorship" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authorship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations has traditionally been attributed to Jeremiah, but the poems themselves make no claim to authorship whatsoever.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jeremianic authorship is possible, and a few commentators continue to argue for it as a reasonable assumption.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, while there are commonalities in style and vocabulary between the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations,&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and no outright contradictions between the two books,&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are also significant differences between them. Jeremiah predicted the destruction of the city and the temple while the author of Lamentations seems surprised by it, and Jeremiah strongly emphasizes the sins of the people while the author of Lamentations hardly mentions them.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These differences in perspective might be the result of the prophet’s experience of the fall of Jerusalem as opposed to merely the anticipation thereof, but more likely whoever composed the book “was familiar with the book of Jeremiah, but had his own vocabulary to express grief over the fall of Jerusalem.”&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commentators argue not only against Jeremianic authorship but for multiple authorship.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Such a reading is hardly required, however. The suggestion that variation in perspective or even poetic style can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be explained by multiple authorship badly underestimates the range of human artistry.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Poetic voice is not the same as &lt;em&gt;authorial&lt;/em&gt; voice;&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the multiple voices which appear throughout the book are “poetic vehicles through which the poet speaks throughout”&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than multiple authors arguing for differing theologies. Even if Lamentations is the product of multiple poets, the poems ultimately represent continuity of thought and theology, both individually and collectively.&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Together, they present a multivocal but coherent expression of grief in the face of horrific tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="context" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="geographical-and-cultural" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Geographical and Cultural&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations was composed in response to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and its temple and the deportation of Judean leadership in 595–587 B.C. However, it is not clear how long after the fall of Jerusalem the poems were composed, nor whether they were composed simultaneously or with some gaps between them. The book was probably composed prior to the rebuilding of the temple in 515 B.C., since the text includes no hint of such a hopeful turn of events,&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the author’s imaginative and lyrical skill count for more than his proximity to the events he describes.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In any case, the date of composition is largely irrelevant to the interpretation of the text.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the Hebrew Bible, Lamentations adopts from but freely adapts genres from the surrounding cultures. Accordingly, it includes elements of Ancient Near East city laments, communal laments, and communal dirges.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Records of city laments in the greater Mesopotamian region date to the beginning of the second millennium B.C., and the author of Lamentations joined various prophetic writers in the Old Testament in repurposing the form for his theological purposes.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whereas most city-laments appear to have been created for rededications of temples and thus include the imagery of a god’s return to the temple, Yahweh is conspicuously absent and his temple in ruins throughout Lamentations.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the theology of Lamentations differs significantly from the city-laments. Though the poet gives full voice to doubt and anger towards Yahweh throughout the book, he ultimately places moral responsibility not on Yahweh but on the sinning people of Jerusalem, very much unlike the anti-theodic bent of other city laments.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The text mingles “penitence &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; protest, confession &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; lament.”&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="literary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Literary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book consists of five poems, each sharing the same basic acrostic structure. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have twenty-two multi-line verses, each beginning with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Chapter 3 changes the pattern, devoting three single-line verses to each letter. Finally, chapter 5 consists of another twenty-two verses of poetry, but does not include the acrostic lettering scheme. The acrostics draw the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and express a sense of completion at their conclusion: grief has been fully sounded and emotional and theological catharsis experienced.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet &lt;em&gt;imposes&lt;/em&gt; order on a world in chaos by choosing to “express the inexpressible… [in poems] whose controlling structural device is the very letters that signify and give shape to language.”&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, the repetition of letters, as of words and ideas throughout the poem, “introduces the indispensable element of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;: reflection and re-reflection on the meaning of the aesthetic message.”&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, the frequent use of enjambment both works with the acrostic to propel the reader forward through the text&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and undermines the poetry’s regularity, allowing the poet to control the pace of the poem “without relying on emplottment [sic] or even strong characterization.”&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These large-scale poetic devices together shape not only the structure but also the message of the poetry: lines give different senses when read alone than when read in their acrostic strophe, and different again when read in the full sequence.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They ultimately “draw the reader into a variety of responses… [not] one particular response.”&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3 is the theological and poetic center of the book.&lt;a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Although some modern commentators hesitate to affirm the centrality of the chapter because of a tendency to downplay the lament elsewhere in the book,&lt;a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are good reasons to take this view. Structurally, the center is often important to Hebrew poetry, and while that importance can be overstated, the placement of the poem here should not be ignored—especially when its poetry and content differ from the others in such a notable way.&lt;a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The increased repetition heightens the effect and draws attention to the content of the poetry.&lt;a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The shorter lines are visually and aurally arresting. The chapter includes theodic content and, at times, a hopeful tone—kinds of content absent in the rest of the poems. It is also the only poem in which words are attributed to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The literary and theological emphasis the poet placed on this chapter is not a reason to ignore the message of the other chapters, but neither should it be ignored in interpreting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter has three major sections, though commentators divide them in slightly different ways; the exegesis below analysis assumes the following division. In the first section (vv. 1–18), “the man who has seen affliction” (3:1) laments his individual suffering at God’s hands. The second section (vv. 19–39) emphasizes Yahweh’s covenant love, trustworthy character, and hatred of injustice; it is the most hopeful and theodic passage in the book. In the third section (vv. 40–66), the speaker responds to the theodic ideas outlined in the second with a complex mix of complaint, lament, hope, and imprecation. This concluding turn has led some commentators to suggest the speaker ultimately could not believe the ethical/theodic message,&lt;a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or that he was angrily determined to “speak in the face of Yahweh’s silence;”&lt;a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it has led others to suggest competing authors (see above). But “[the] speaker is not schizophrenic.”&lt;a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The same person may simultaneously recognize his own sinful responsibility, trust God, and yet remain long for deliverance from and be troubled by his suffering.&lt;a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Though all of these themes appear scattered throughout the book, Lamentations 3 alone draws them together in a single poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section begins in v. 40. Although there are later topical and vocal shifts (especially in v. 42; see below), none are as strong as the one leading the נ-strophe, which is doubly marked. The speaker shifts from general statements about Yahweh to exhortation of the listening community precisely at the transition from the מ-strophe to the נ-strophe. Indeed, given the enjambment across strophe boundaries typical of the final section of the poem,&lt;a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the alignment here clearly indicates a major transition in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="exegesis" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Exegesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;section id="we-repent-but-god-has-not-forgiven-us-4051" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Repent but God Has Not Forgiven Us (40–51)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker has finished his discourse on who Yahweh is and how he acts; now it is time to respond. In light of the preceding declaration of Yahweh’s covenant love and justice, and its “emphasis on confession and penitence”&lt;a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker urges his people to turn and repent. He turns almost immediately to a lengthy lament, however: God has not forgiven. Indeed, the divine warrior has struck down his own people.&lt;a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Things seems hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="let-us-repent-4042a" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let us repent! (40–42a)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yahweh’s covenant love may be trusted and he judges rightly, and if his people have sinned, they ought to repent. The speaker employs the language of (especially Jeremianic) prophetic exhortation, calling the people to search out and examine their ways and return to Yahweh.&lt;a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Unlike in Jeremiah, though, the speaker includes himself in the call to repentance. The opening verbs of the section are not imperatives but cohortatives (נַחְפְּשָׂ֤ה, נַחְקֹ֔רָה, נָשׁ֖וּבָה). The speaker thus affirms that his and his people’s sin has led to their current condition; they must repent. The imperfect that follows (נִשָּׂ֤א) picks up the force of the preceding cohortatives and continues the exhortation. The language of “hearts with hands” reminds the reader that the repentance required is an act of the whole person: neither merely internal nor merely external.&lt;a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The reference to “God in heaven” does double duty: it marks his authority to forgive, but it also suggests his absence from Zion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="god-is-still-hidden-42b44" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;God is still hidden (42b–44)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following verses, the author begins by confessing sin, then addresses Yahweh, who has not forgiven his people, and who has instead opposed them and hidden himself from their prayers. Israel’s divine warrior-God has now become her enemy.&lt;a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The God whose presence with his people was so often manifest as a cloud&lt;a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now removed his presence from them with a cloud.&lt;a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The people may confess, but unless Yahweh hears their prayers and answers them, they will remain destitute and hopeless.&lt;a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In light of the speaker’s confession and the hope expressed in the preceding major section, that Yahweh has not forgiven comes as a surprise, and one intensified dramatically by the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the poetry here is enjambed twice, making it one of the more prominent of the many instances of the poetic device throughout this section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, the poet introduces the address to Yahweh at the end of the נ-strophe instead of at beginning of the ס-strophe. Second, the poet splits the line itself. The first verset continues the thought of the preceding two lines: the people’s repentance before God, in the form of confession: “we have transgressed and rebelled.” The second verset indicates God’s response: “—you have not forgiven!” There is no transition, not even a disjunctive-ו to mark the shift—just a terse pair of statements. Indeed, the effect is so jarring, especially as it leads into the next strophe, that it is tempting to read the entire rest of the poem as accusation against and anger against God.&lt;a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Understandable as this reading is—especially as a backlash against the inappropriate suppression of lament among Christians—it is mistaken, as will become clear.&lt;a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;49&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; complain here and in what follows, but that is not all he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tonal shift between v. 42a and v. 42b, it is possible to read this as the break between the second and third major sections of the book. As noted above, the major discourse boundary is between vv. 39 and 40 instead, where the speaker transitions from exposition to response. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a segue here, as the speaker turns his attention from his community to Yahweh, and begins a speech section that runs through v. 47, but this transition is within rather than between sections—from one kind of response to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="we-are-devastated-by-our-enemies-4547" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We are devastated by our enemies (45–47)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the poet employs enjambment to drive the reader into the speaker’s experience of suffering. The transition between the ס- and פ-strophes occurs in v. 46, but already in v. 45 the speaker returns to a theme expressed in the beginning of the chapter as well as in the preceding poems: enemies attacking the people of God. Not only is Yahweh absent from Zion, but he has made her like refuse and waste&lt;a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of the peoples. The tribes he had chosen to be a blessing to the nations (Gen. 12:3; 18:17–19) and set apart as a kingdom of priests (Exod. 19:6; Deut. 17:18) were defilement—things to be thrown out of the camp (cf. Exod. 29:14). Moreover, rather than delivering from enemies, God has brought them against his people.&lt;a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They have “opened their mouths” against God’s people, an image used in the Wisdom literature both of speaking against someone and of devouring them (Job 29:23; Ps. 5:9; 22:13; 35:21). The climax of the quotation comes in verse 47, a chiasm on two pairs of words which rhyme almost completely.&lt;a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “Dread and death, devastation and ruination”—this is what Yahweh has accomplished in bringing these enemies against his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This judgment may not have been unexpected—everything that happened to Jerusalem was expressly the result of a covenant curse—but the circumstances were no less horrific for that. That the judgment was deserved did not lessen the urgency of the speaker’s cry for relief.&lt;a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker’s complaint raises the poem’s tension by pitting this lament against the theodic material which precedes it.&lt;a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker may not be shaking his fist at the heavens, but he is certainly complaining loudly and questioning insistently. If Yahweh is loving, faithful, and just, is this judgment not too harsh? At this point, the ethical vision expressed in vv. 19–39 seems lost. Indeed, Miriam Bier and F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp both suggest that the poet &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to embrace the ethical vision, but that this and the section following demonstrate his inability to do so.&lt;a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Were this the final note of the poem, this analysis would be basically correct. It is not, but things get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="sight-and-salvation-4851" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sight and salvation (48–51)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker echoes the end of v. 47 at the end of v. 48, tying the two together, but shifts in person (from “we” to “I”).&lt;a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The identity of the speaker shifts slightly as a result: he spoke first for himself alone, then exhorted his community, and now stands in solidarity with the community of Zion.&lt;a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The poet connects these verses, from the last line of the פ-strophe through the whole ע-strophe, with the idea of eyes and sight. The poet’s eyes pour out channels of water and flow without ceasing or respite, until Yahweh looks and sees. The poet and his people desperately need Yahweh’s deliverance—and Yahweh remains enthroned in heaven. The poet carefully reiterates the idea suggested in the נ-strophe, delaying the subject of v. 50 to the second half of the line to match the structure of v. 41. The inclusio emphasizes both Yahweh’s sovereignty and his distance from his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Yahweh sees—until he stops shrouding himself from his people’s prayers and hears their cries as he did in Exodus 1—the poet’s eyes continue to torment him because of the sad state of the women of the city (v. 51). The final line is curiously expressive: the speaker’s eyes are harsh to his soul—a phrase that has been taken to mean that his eyes literally ache from his crying and that the things he sees torment him.&lt;a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, the terse language suggests both: in the immediate context, the speaker’s weeping wears him out; more broadly, soul-distressing suffering is nearly omnipresent in these poems. Although he clearly hopes for change, he is no longer addressing Yahweh as of v. 48. He simply states how things are and will remain until God acts: these horrors demand grief. And perhaps Yahweh will hear these tears, even if he seems to have heard nothing else (though nothing in the context or language here suggests these tears are meant to &lt;em&gt;manipulate&lt;/em&gt; God into responding).&lt;a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The section closes without any such response, though; all hope seems lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="deliver-me-from-my-enemies-5266" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deliver me from my enemies! (52–66)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concluding section is like an individual psalm of lament.&lt;a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It continues the shift begun in v. 19. The chapter (as well as the book) opens with the image of God as a divine warrior fighting against his people, but it concludes with a plea for God to act in line with his character.&lt;a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The speaker hopes that Yahweh will restore his people to covenant unity with him and defend them from their enemies, but refuses to collapse the tension between hope and lament that characterizes the whole poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-verb-tense-and-meaning-in-poetry" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Verb Tense and Meaning in Poetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb tense throughout the final section of the poem is a subject of much debate. Commentators differ especially on how to take the mix of perfects and imperfects in vv. 56–58, but significant differences appear beginning as early as v. 52. Some take the verbs to be a mix of past statement and present need or imperative,&lt;a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but this does not account for the ongoing nature of the speaker’s distress (as indicated by the imperatives in the following section).&lt;a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others read both the perfects and imperfects as a series of present-tense declarations of faith.&lt;a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This view rightly captures the sense of present distress, but does not account for the perfect-imperfect alternation and has no basis for distinguishing between these “present-tense” perfects and the ordinary past-tense perfects that precede them. Thus, some suggest that the perfects carry a precative sense, with the imperfects then naturally reading as more imperatives.&lt;a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In addition to being an unusual and debated syntactical stance, however, this also fails to answer why the poet did not use simple imperatives (as in vv. 59, 63). Even if these verbs simply represent the poet shifting to the perfect-imperfect alternation common to poetry,&lt;a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is the only place in the entire final section of the poem where the pattern appears. At the least, it marks the sequence by distinction with the surrounding verses. Thus, none of the proposals satisfactorily account for all the features of the text, though perfect-as-precative is not unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, of course, that this ambiguity is a function only of modern scholars’ relative ignorance of the language—that native speakers readily took in the meaning of the poetry when Lamentations was written. It is equally plausible, however, that the poet &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; the meaning to remain elusive. This is one of the functions of poetry: to push the boundaries of what language can express and thereby convey feeling and sense beyond the merely literal. The poet in Lamentations employs a wide array of tools to this end in this final section of the poem, including structure (the acrostic), enjambment, rhythm, rhyme and assonance, ellipsis, and allusion. Perhaps the poet wanted audience to wonder: has Yahweh delivered already, spoken already, judged the enemies already—or is the speaker still waiting for Yahweh to hear his prayers? In the world of faith, the answer may be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;: the believer may be fully confident that Yahweh’s answer is assured, and still feel no less keenly the fact that experience does not yet bear out that answer. The text is open; it not only allows for but actively invites both readings.&lt;a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “[Both] past and future signify the ongoing present. The suffering in Lamentations is timeless, and the expression of timelessness seems to have been one of the poet’s goals.”&lt;a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="my-enemies-despair-and-pleading-5255" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My enemies! Despair and pleading (52–55)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The צ-strophe opens with a stereotyped image of the beleaguered servant of God: the person hunted like a bird (cf. Prov. 6:5; Pss. 11:1, 124:7, 140:5) by those who hated him for no reason (cf. 1 Sam. 19:15, 25:31; Ps. 35:7, 69:5). The strophe continues with a description of the enemies’ depredations. The circuitous language (literally, they put an end to his life, with the action occurring in a pit) conveys the idea of people seeking to end his life by throwing him into a pit and hurling stones at him (cf. Pss. 18:41, 73:27, 94:23).&lt;a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The image is not a dry pit like the ones Joseph and Jeremiah were thrown into (Gen. 38:24; Jer. 38:6). Instead, water went up over the speaker’s head (cf. Ps: 69:1–2). Besides being yet more stock lament imagery,&lt;a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the water language connects this sequence back to the preceding one, even as the focus has changed. So likewise with the “pit” language, whose implied metaphorical use as a substitute for death or the grave&lt;a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;71&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is heightened by proximity to v. 47, where it is used precisely that way. The poetry is also enjambed again much as it was at the end of the נ-strophe. The first half of the line in v. 54 continues the complaint theme of the preceding verses, but the latter half begins a recitation of speech to and interaction with Yahweh. The poet carries this theme further as he begins the ק-strophe (v. 55) with the speaker’s having cried out Yahweh’s name from the “deepest pit,” a phrase suggestive of Sheol.&lt;a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these verses is particularly striking or unusual next to other laments in the Old Testament, and this is in its own way significant. The speaker has made a small but meaningful change in his language and tone: Yahweh is no longer the enemy but instead the one who might deliver &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the enemies.&lt;a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The turn to traditional, even stereotyped, language of lament and petition signals the speaker’s self-conscious identification with Israel’s history of trusting Yahweh for deliverance. This does not mark the resolution of the trial, but it does undercut the idea that the end of the poem is unrelentingly pessimistic—especially when coupled with the verses that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="yahweh-hearsmay-yahweh-hear-5658" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Yahweh hears/May Yahweh hear (56–58)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next sequence (continuing the ק-strophe and running into the first line of the ר-strophe) is a striking sequence and is key to understanding the poet’s intent in the final section of the poem. The speaker proclaims Yahweh’s response to his call for help from the edge of death. Per the discussion above, this section is best read as holding together the tensions of past-and-future, actual-and-desired: “you heard my voice” and “hear my voice” (v. 56); “you came on the day I called” and “come on the day I call,” “you said to me” and “say to me” (v. 57); “you strove for my life” and “strive for my life” (v. 58). This is the climax of the final section, the place where the poet’s pleas climax and, more significantly, the only place in the entire book where Yahweh speaks. The words the poet attributes to Yahweh are simple—אַל־תִּירָֽא, “do not fear”—but pack depths into their brief syllables. For the canonically attentive reader, these words immediately call to mind all the places Yahweh tells his people not to fear, and where he inevitably promised his presence and his aid to his people against their enemies.&lt;a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet the poet elides the second part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to take the poet’s intended sense without paying attention to “the way in which the sequence as a whole coheres and interacts, and even to how the poet articulates theological interests.”&lt;a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This allusion grounds the final segment of the poem in a measure of hope. At the same time, by leaving the promise of Yahweh’s presence merely an allusion, rather than stating it straight out, the poet carefully sustains the tension between &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;not-yet&lt;/em&gt; that drives the conclusion of the poem. Turn the phrases one way, and the speaker is pleading for God to comfort his people by making his presence known; turn them the other and the speaker is proclaiming that this is precisely what God has already done. Both perspectives affirm the community’s need for deliverance and for Yahweh’s presence to return; but the poetry hangs between the two, unresolved. The poet has left both readings possible, perhaps even necessary. Complaint remains,&lt;a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;76&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; yet Israel’s hope that Yahweh was and would be with them remains, too.&lt;a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="may-yahweh-judge-the-enemies-5966" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May Yahweh judge the enemies (59–66)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem concludes with the resumption of the speaker’s complaint about the enemies, followed by an imprecatory prayer against them; both the complaint and the imprecation echo the imprecatory psalms.&lt;a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The only two imperatives proper in vv. 40–66 appear here: the speaker pleads with God to judge his case (v. 59) and to observe his enemies’ actions (v. 63). In the complaint, which takes up the final line of the ר-strophe and the entire ש-strophe, he lists out his enemies’ offenses. They sought (unwarranted) vengeance on, connived against, reproached, rose up against, slandered, plotted against, and made a mockery of him (cf. 14:16–17, 23:7).&lt;a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The lines are terse and elliptical, with verbs few and far between; the result reads like a list of charges in a court case, crying out for a verdict.&lt;a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imprecatory prayer comprises the ת-strophe, where a series of imperfects take up an imperatival force. The only unusual item in the list is the phrase translated “obstinate hearts,” מְגִנַּת, a hapax which appears only here and may be derived from מָגֵן, “shield.” Literally, the speaker asks for Yahweh to give them something like “covering-of-heart”—the idea seems to be hard-heartedness (thus “obstinate”)—so that the enemies will receive the judgment they are due (cf. Exo. 7:3,13).&lt;a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These imprecations are not merely selfish requests for personal vengeance. Rather, they are a plea for Yahweh to execute divine justice, in line with his character as speaker described it in the middle section of the poem.&lt;a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not that the poet thinks that his proclamation of faith resolved everything. Instead, echoing both the Psalms and Jeremiah,&lt;a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;83&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the speaker implores Yahweh for deliverance, confident that God &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help but desperately needing that ability to become action.&lt;a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poem ends on an unresolved note, unlike most of the psalms of imprecation or lament (notable exceptions including Pss. 44, 60).&lt;a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But this is appropriate to the poet’s aims. He presents not a cheery resolve to act as though everything is better in light of the ethical and theodic vision presented in vv. 19–39, but rather an attempt to apply that vision when circumstances remain unchanged.&lt;a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The result is closure, but not resolution. The acrostic is complete, and the speaker’s grief has been expiated to a degree—but until things are right again, pleading and lament remain. Yahweh may be good and his judgments righteous, but that does not require his people’s silence when he punishes them. To the contrary, it allows them to express their grief and anger in the hope of a merciful and gracious response from their covenant God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading makes sense of the shape of the poem as a whole. Because of the brighter notes sounded in vv. 19–39, a few commentators take this poem as ending positively.&lt;a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Others take the final 26 verses as a negative response to the (apparently) rhetorical questions posed in vv. 36–39.&lt;a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;88&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Neither of these readings does justice to the tension of the poetry. Instead, the poet has played the enjambment card again, at a yet larger level. The final (originally rhetorical) question of the middle section actually received an answer: Why should a man complain about the punishment of his sins? Because even when the judgment was deserved, Yahweh may yet answer, silence the enemy, and draw near to his people. In one sense, he already has; in another, his people are still waiting—and the poet leaves it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="application" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, scholars have applied Lamentations to everything from Freudian grief models&lt;a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to massive national tragedies.&lt;a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Freudian model of grief has some serious deficiencies—but applications of Lamentations 3 in that context do help people both to articulate their grief and to respond to loss.&lt;a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Application to national tragedies is even more appropriate. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen horrific loss of life; even in largely untouched America, community has disintegrated over the same period. Thus, “the unrelenting relevance of this poetry cries out to be heard and understood.”&lt;a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reading Lamentations more frequently and deeply will help Western Christians understand the trials of fellow believers enduring persecution for the name of Christ. It will also provide a framework for sympathizing with peoples around the world facing ethnic cleansing or other such horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These realities are painful, but they are realities nonetheless. With some of the Psalms, Lamentations addresses human suffering head-on as few other places in Scripture do, pointing the way to a deep, rich, honest, and trusting response to tragedy. The concluding section of chapter 3 is particularly helpful: God sometimes delays his deliverance; repentance does not always lead immediately to restoration; and the enemies of God’s people go on harassing them far longer than seems right. In those moments, people and their pastors have a model to follow: crying out to God as long as his answer remains &lt;em&gt;already-but-not-yet&lt;/em&gt;. Believers ought to spend time reading, meditating on, and praying through these words. Pastors should acquaint themselves with the book deeply so they can minister to their congregants facing trials, and they should preach on it more often to equip their congregations for those trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamentations 3:40–66 represents an invitation to cry out to God even in the midst of judgment—to believe that he may yet hear. In their hesitation to voice this kind of lament at in the face of life’s travails, many Christians reveal that they do not know their God as well as they ought. “The suffering is, as it were, an affirmation that God is still there and still concerned with the fate of Israel. He may hide his face, but he has not ceased to be Israel’s God.”&lt;a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If even God’s judgment on Israel was a painful picture of his faithfulness, how much more when he has shared our griefs, borne our sufferings in his own flesh, and been judged to the point of crying out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And so he remains open to his people’s cries—for, until suffering ends, lament remains.&lt;/p&gt;

Div.</category><category>papers</category></item><item><title>An Uncomfortable Fit</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2015/an-uncomfortable-fit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a small, non-denominational, baptistic, charismatic church. Speaking in tongues, the use of private prayer languages, claims to words of knowledge and prophecies, and the expectation of miraculous healings were common. Unfortunately, even granting a continuationist view of the gifts, the church’s practice was never in line with New Testament guidelines for the gifts—no translation of tongues, for example, or requirement that prophecy be fulfilled for the prophet to be judged true. I grew disillusioned with the charismatic approach to the gifts by late high school, and spent several of the following years as a near-cessationist. I remain skeptical of most charismatic churches’ practice of the gifts, but am not a cessationist: I see no compelling exegetical argument for the position. I am especially open to the likelihood of the miraculous gifts in frontier missions context, where they serve to validate the proclamation of the gospel over and above demonic powers worshipped in polytheistic, animistic, and shamanistic cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, I spent two years attending a fairly traditional Southern Baptist church. For the latter half of my time in college and the three years following, I was a member of a non-demoninational, baptistic, broadly evangelical church with my wife Jaimie. During that time, I remained baptistic, but began to become concerned with the lack of confessional moorings in most baptistic churches (denominational or non-denominational alike). Along the way, I shifted from the non-Calvinistic views held by most charismatics and Baptists to an Edwardsian Calvinism and developed stronger convictions about church polity. Finally, since moving to North Carolina, we have been committed members at First Baptist Church of Durham—a healthy, elder-led, Calvinistic Southern Baptist church that we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even here, we find that we are not totally “at home”; it is not quite right to call even Calvinistic Southern Baptists “my tradition”. Indeed, it is perhaps most accurate to say that I have not yet &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; my tradition. What I have found instead are points to appreciate in a number of traditions, and an increasing identification (at least from the outside) with many elements of the Presbyterian tradition. A friend once described me as a “Pres-matic Bapt-erian”, and he seems to have been right. I find much to appreciate in the charismatic background from which I sprang, and much to value in the Baptist tradition where I currently live—but at the end of the day, it is only my credobaptist convictions keeping me within the Baptist world, rather than transitioning into Presbyterianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the charismatic tradition in which I grew up, I learned the value of affections oriented toward Christ. It is not enough to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the things of God; we must also love him and one another. Our faith must be true &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; experiential. John reminds us that “this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (John 17:3) and that “Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness” (1 John 2:9). Moreover, they emphasized that walking in the Holy Spirit is essential to the healthy Christian life. Though I might now characterize the Spirit’s primary work differently from the church of my childhood, I still affirm whole-heartedly that the Christian life is deeply and profoundly dependent on the Holy Spirit. Paul enjoins us, “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh…. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16, 25). Likewise, John reports Jesus’ shocking statement that it is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; for us that he left and sent the Spirit than that he should have remained with us (John 16:7ff.). The life of the Christian must be a Spirit-filled and Spirit-empowered life. We can never overemphasize the work of the Spirit in our lives (though we may sometimes articulate that work inaccurately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Southern Baptist churches I have attended I have gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of evangelism and missions. Whether from the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20 or the similar notes sounded in Luke 24:45–49 and then throughout the book of Acts, it is clear that God’s people are called to evangelize wherever we go. (Closely related to the above point, however, this is not mere salesmanship. As Luke points out in Acts 1:8, the power for the church’s missionary work is the Holy Spirit, not human wisdom.) If the church forgets that her first and foremost calling is the proclamation of the gospel to all the nations, she will rapidly fall off the cart in one direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Baptist emphasis on regenerate church membership and the congregation’s responsibility for discipline are also essential ingredients to healthy, flourishing churches (and therefore for flourishing individual Christians). The countless “one another” passages of the New Testament ( e.g. John 13:34–35, Ephesians 4:25–32) emphasize mutual service as an essential mark of Christian fellowship. Moreover, the well-known church discipline passages (Matthew 18:15–20) indicate clearly that the members of a congregation are to look out for each other’s spiritual well-being. Although this care has sometimes been twisted to abuse in other churches, we are blessed to participate in a context where the passages’ emphasis on forgiveness and restoration is kept front and center. Meaningful membership and congregational care through church discipline are not universally popular, but they are among the hallmarks of our particular corner of the Southern Baptist convention. This kind of care for the saints is not only necessary: it is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my Presbyterian friends I have increasingly come to appreciate a more thoroughly confessional identity and the value of churches connected not only by sharing funds but also by polity. Acts 15 highlights that the early church resolved its most significant outstanding tension not by letting each church go its own way doctrinally, but by issuing a decision that was binding on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the churches. Granted: the presence of the apostles then means our situation is not identical. Still, the event demands attention. Even a church with the illustrious history and (apostolic!) leadership of the congregation at Antioch did not feel equipped to make serious doctrinal decisions without consulting the rest of the church. This is not to deny that there are clear marks of local congregational responsibility throughout the epistles, only that the New Testament pattern was of churches in active contact, cooperation, and doctrinal dependence with each other in a way that appears &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; similar to a proto-presbytery, and quite unlike the radical autonomy of Baptist churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the historic Reformed articulation of the relationship between the various spheres of life extremely compelling. Calvin and his heirs often advocated clearly and coherently for the goodness of the created order and for human activity therein. Here, vocation (including the arts) is taken not merely as a means to gospel proclamation, but as genuinely good in itself. This theme runs throughout Scripture: God commanded man to work before the Fall ( cf. Genesis 2:5,15), and though work has been corrupted and made toilsome by the Fall, it remains good. The world itself was created good (Genesis 1), and though it groans with us for redemption (Romans 8:19–23) it still proclaims the glory of God (see Psalm 19 for just one of many examples). Many evangelicals pay lip service to the goodness of creation and vocation, but few outside the high church traditions (especially Anglican, Lutheran, and Presbyterian) carry the doctrine through in their practice. This leaves me hungry for the kind of intellectual, vocational, and artistic engagement I see in those traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late modern evangelicalism more broadly I have imbibed both my essential Christian temperament—my unsettled, “post-denominational” eccesiastical identity included!—and two other essential ingredients: a sense of catholicity, and a desire to do more and better in caring for “the least of these.” Set against Jesus’ “new command” in John 13, the divisions within the church are painful realities we should strive to see undone wherever possible. Our disagreements are not trivial; we cannot simply toss them aside. We can, however, glory in our common experience of “mere Christianity” and take opportunities where possible to worship our risen Lord together. We can also work together across denominational boundaries to care for the orphans and widows (James 1:27), to confront injustice in this age. The needs of the world around us are severe and painful; the various wings of the church can and should unite to bring what tastes we can of the justice and mercy of Christ’s kingdom into the present age—in the church, and everywhere else (Micah 6:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I have found in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these movements a consistent emphasis on the centrality, authority, and sufficiency of Scripture. From my charismatic, Arminian-leaning youth minister to the pastors of the middle-America Bible church I attended during and after college to the elders of Calvinistic Baptist church we now call home, all have pointed consistently to God’s word as his ultimate self-revelation. These churches have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; lived out a commitment to the idea that God’s word is living and active (Hebrews 4:12) and profitable in every way (2 Timothy 3:16–17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the number of shifts in my past, the transition to another tradition would be relatively straightforward; apart from the issue of believer’s baptism, Presbyterianism looks quite appealing even now. Even beyond these more important convictional differences, I do not fit comfortably within the Baptistic tradition culturally. Its populism often verges on (and sometimes crosses into) anti-intellectualism. Its broadly helpful focus on evangelism and missions too often translates into a reductive approach that reduces all spheres of life to vehicles for gospel-proclamation—not recognizing that while in God’s providence they often serve as such, the myriad spheres of life are good in their own right. The Southern Baptist identification with the culture of the South is also problematic for someone culturally not a Southerner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions on the nature of the church and the history of the Baptist movement in this class have largely solidified my pre-existing discomfort within the Baptist tradition and somewhat intensified the struggle to define my ecclesiastical identity. The theological commitments and cultural habits of (especially Southern) Baptists trouble me deeply. Reading &lt;em&gt;The Baptist Way&lt;/em&gt; had precisely the opposite effect Norman intended: his polemical rhetoric bore the marks of profound ignorance of other traditions. Much of the reading on believers’ baptism was similarly dismissive—arguing not against the substance of other positions, but instead against caricatures thereof. Dockery’s call for renewal and consensus was more helpful, but it, too, had a sectarian bent. The denomination’s (and the broader tradition’s) deep anti-intellectualism and lasting suspicion of creeds and confessions make it unlikely that Southern Baptists will be able to claim the confessional identity or theological consensus they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an unfortunate reality that my experience of Baptists has too often been marked by denominational sectarianism, anti-intellectualism and anti-creedalism, and reductionistic and utilitarian approaches to God’s world. To be sure, there are exceptions to these trends, and I am grateful for them. But it means that, credobaptist though I am, “Baptist” and especially “Southern Baptist” are not and cannot be my ecclesiastical &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; unless they comes to mean something very different than they have for many years. In the meantime, I will remain a “Pres-matic Bap-terian”, and deeply grateful for the traditions that have shaped me and especially our current church—even when they are not a “perfect fit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology and Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two practices embraced universally throughout the Christian church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Even with these, serious differences remain, reflecting deeper distinctions in the theology and practice of the church. In the case of baptism, the questions of its meaning and mode tend to reflect the believer’s views on the nature of God’s saving work, the covenant community, and the church. Who should be baptized, and how, where, and under what circumstances are difficult, important questions. Believers must consider them carefully and hold their conclusions humbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptismal-theology" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baptismal Theology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism should be applied to believers, and is best carried out by immersion. However, while Baptist churches have often tended toward a dogmatic position on these, leading to a frequent practice of rebaptism, more caution is necessary—especially on the second point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="meaning" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the covenant sign of one’s entrance into the Christian faith, and also a means of grace in the life of the Christian—not &lt;em&gt;saving&lt;/em&gt; grace, but real grace nonetheless, in the same way that fellowship with the saints, the preaching of the word, and the Lord’s supper are.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; God works grace in the life of believers in their obedience to his commands, of which baptism is among the clearest in the New Testament (Matt. 28:18–20, Acts 2:38). Moreover, it is the symbol and in some mysterious way also a means of the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14), an element of his union with Christ’s church (Eph. 4:4–6), and his appeal to God for a pure conscience (1 Pet. 3:21–22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is not merely a symbolic ordinance&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but, as these passages make clear, a place in which God works uniquely in the life of the believer. Neither is paptism a work necessary for salvation, as is clear from the salvation of the thief on the cross (Luke 23:42–43, as well as from many other places that teach that faith alone is necessary for salvation). Nor is there warrant in Scripture for the idea that baptism is a means of regeneration or cleansing from original sin. Nonetheless, paptism is ordinarily a part of God’s saving work in his people’s lives. The reality that some are saved who are never baptized does not mean it plays no part in the believer’s life, but rather that its part is in &lt;em&gt;sanctification&lt;/em&gt; rather than in &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="mode" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all Baptists historically have argued on the basis of the New Testament language that baptism &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be by immersion. The word βαπτίζω, usually transliterated to English as “baptize” rather than translated, is a secondary verb derived from the root βάπτω, broadly meaning simply “to dip or immerse.” While a full exegetical treatment is beyond the scope of this essay, two points must be remembered in any discussion of baptism. First, the normal meaning of both these words &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dipping or immersion, and there are a number of examples which strongly suggest going down into and coming up out of standing water (Matt. 3:6–17, Mark 1:4–11, John 3:22, Acts 8:36–39). Second, however, the lexical domain of these verbs and of the various words derived from them within the New Testament alone is broader than dipping or immersion, and certainly includes the notion of washing.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, its figurative uses throughout the New Testament range far more broadly than “immersion” alone: it includes partaking of trials (Mark 10:38, Luke 12:50); the transfoming work of the Spirit (Matt. 3:11, Acts 1:5, Acts 11:16), and even the Israelites’ passing through water without getting wet (1 Cor. 10:2). The most significant of these metaphorical texts is Paul’s argument that in baptism believers have been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3–4, Col. 2:8–14). The parallel imagery between the two is clear and potent: baptism visualizes death and resurrection. However, Paul’s parallel uses of the word “baptism” and “baptize” (e.g. 1 Cor. 12:13, Gal. 3:27) with “in Christ” demonstrate that the point of these passages is union with Christ—not mode of baptism. Immersion illustrates this reality most effectively, but immersion is not commanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be granted, then, that the primary meaning of the word group is of dipping or immersion, but that it also includes a broader sense of washing or transformation. Likewise, given what documents there are from the first and second century, it seems safe to say that baptism was normally by immersion in the early church. However, it is too much to say that immersion is &lt;em&gt;demanded&lt;/em&gt; by the language used or by the examples in the New Testament. Rather, it should be preferred as the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way of expressing visually the death, burial and resurrection of the believer with Christ as well as the cleansing and transformative elements of the practice. At the same time, those who practice baptism by immersion should not reject baptisms by sprinkling or pouring as false or unbiblical baptisms.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="subject" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate over the &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; of baptism is similarly heated. There are essentially two positions on who should be baptized (with some variations in each position): that only new believers should be baptized, or that new believers and the children of believers should be baptized. While there are some important differences regarding the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the baptism of believers, it is the universal practice of all Christian churches. The baptism of infants or as-yet-unbelieving children of newly converted parents, however, has been attributed a wide number of meanings, ranging from cleansing from original sin and the beginning of the individual’s own work of salvation (the Catholic view) to entrance into the covenant community conditioned on personal faith (the Presbyterian view).&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the vast majority of Christians throughout all history prior to the 20th century baptized infants. On the other hand, the believer is responsible finally to submit to the Bible, tradition notwithstanding; if the Scriptures teaches credobaptism, even the weight of so much tradition must be set aside. Nonetheless, church history is often illuminating for difficult interpretive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest unambiguous mention of infant baptism is Tertullian’s condemnation of the practice in 198 A.D. Less than two decades later, though, Hippolytus advocated the baptism of children incapable of answering for themselves less than two decades later (parents or other relatives were to speak on behalf of their children).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Some argue that the commands for those baptized in earlier documents such as the &lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; precludes children’s having been baptized, but this is an argument from silence—and these same kinds of commands appear in the “Apostolic Tradition” following the instruction regarding children. In any case, practice in the church was mixed by the end of the second century at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence from New Testament practice is also ambiguous.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is true that in the cases where the recipients of baptism are clearly delineated, they are believers. However, any argument regarding the household baptisms is necessarily an argument from silence. There is no grounds in the text for asserting that &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the households that received baptism included infants or small children incapable of professing faith.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To say otherwise is to read one’s theological presuppositions into the text. By the same token, however, paedobaptists have no more warrant than do credobaptists for claiming these passages as clear evidence for their view. Believers may of course argue that these passages should be interpreted in light of their understanding of the rest of the New Testament—but without the dogmatism too often present on both sides. The passages simply do not say; indeed, no passage in the New Testament even speaks clearly about believing children.&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the subject of baptism can be determined only through the passages that teach about its meaning and function in the life of the believer. Covenantal paedobaptists&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argue that, in continuity with the pattern of the Abrahamic Covenant, children of believers—that is, children of those who are themselves members of the covenant community of faith—should be baptized. They note, rightly, that the major points of discontinuity marked off by the New Covenant are with the &lt;em&gt;Mosaic&lt;/em&gt; covenant rather than the Abrahamic Covenant. As such, they suggest that just as the (male) children of members of the Abrahamic covenant were circumcised to symbolize their entrance into the covenant community, so likewise (all) children of members of the New Covenant should be baptized. The covenant view rightly distinguishes between the role of the symbol and the necessary faith of the believer. It also rightly identifies the church with Abraham’s offspring (cf. Luke 3:7–9) and takes seriously the teaching in both Testaments that Abraham and his offspring were saved by faith, not merely by being members of the people of Israel (see esp. Gal. 3:1–6).&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the Abrahamic covenant led directly to the New Covenant, it nonetheless had an ethnic or national bent to it that the New Covenant does not. The Abrahamic covenant was with Abraham and his offspring in a specific nation, though for the good of all nations (Gen. 12:1–7, 15:1–21, 17:1–14). Circumcision was established for Abraham and his descendants as their act of covenant (Gen 17:9–14). Yet the New Testament unambiguously does away with circumcision as the mark of participation in God’s community (cf. Acts 10:1–48, 16:3, 1 Cor. 7:18, Gal. 2:3, 5:2). The New Covenant circumcision is one “made without hands” (Col. 2:11; cf. Deut. 30:6, Rom. 2:29) and is tied directly to baptism—“the circumcision of Christ” (Col. 2:11b–12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covenant paedobaptist is right that baptism is to the church what circumcision was to the Jews, but wrong about how entrance into the covenant community now comes about.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Again: salvation was always by faith, but the people of God are no longer constituted ethnically or nationally, but by faith alone. To become one of God’s people in the Abrahamic covenant was to join the nation of Israel; even when, as in Ruth’s case, that commitment was one of faith it was also national and ethnic. It is no longer. Those who are to be baptized are those who have become disciples (Matt. 28:18–20), repented (Acts 2:38–39), been united with Christ in his death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3, Col 2:12), put on Christ (Gal. 3:27), asked God for cleansing from sin (Acts 22:17) and for a clear conscience (1 Pet. 3:21). In the New Covenant, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; those who profess faith are marked as belonging to the people of God.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the practice described in the New Testament, then, only believers should be baptized today: those who have made a clear and credible profession of faith. However, those who affirm believer’s baptism should be careful not to overstate their case. While the New Testament does incline this way, there is no slam-dunk case, and no therefore warrant for sneering at those who disagree. Moreover, other convictions held in light of one’s position on baptism must be held moderately, in light of the provisional character of the doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="excursus-rebaptism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Excursus: Rebaptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebaptism is a serious matter. It argues that the first baptism a person underwent was not in fact a Christian baptism at all, for one should not otherwise be rebaptized. There is only one instance of rebaptism recorded in the New Testament: that of the believers in Ephesus (Acts 19), who had not been baptized in the name of Jesus at all. If the meaning, mode, and subject of baptism as outlined above are correct, then it is appropriate to rebaptize those who have been baptized as unbelievers (including as children) or by those who are not orthodox Christians (e.g. Mormons). However, it is inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized by a mode other than immersion,&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the mode of baptism is neither a primary issue nor a point asserted dogmatically anywhere in Scripture. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to rebaptize those who were baptized as believers, but by churches holding differing views on the meaning of baptism but which are nonetheless true Christian churches. Any baptism applied to a believer on a valid profession of faith by a true church ought to be respected by other Christian churches.&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Lord’s Supper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Baptists have argued that the Lord’s Supper should be reserved for those who have been baptized as believers, by immersion—a position that dates from the origin of Baptist life (in the writings of William Kiffen) to the present day (see the Baptist Faith and Message 2000 for just one example). A minority of Baptists throughout the history of the movement (famously including John Bunyan) have argued to the contrary: that the table ought to be open to any who have given a valid profession of faith, or are members in good standing of other Christian churches. Finally, a yet-smaller group has practiced local-church-only communion, in which only the members of a given congregation may partake of communion there. The first position, though most common, is perhaps least sustainable in the author’s view. The fully open and local-church-only views are more self-consistent in their interpretation of the relevant passages on the Lord’s Supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those answering this question are attempting to deal rightly with the reality that coming to the Table is a serious matter. The New Testament teaches that Christians are not to partake of the meal with those who are in unrepentant sin (1 Cor. 5) and warns that judgment will come on those who themselves partake of the meal while unrepentant (1 Cor. 11:20–30). Moreover, unrepentant sin is the only boundary set around the table in the New Testament. But arguing that being mistaken about even a practice so central as baptism constitutes unrepentant sin is problematic. There are other doctrines of denomination-forming importance, and which believers regard as sin issues; if this logic were to be applied consistently, Christians could never share the Table with anyone who did not share their every denominational distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mike Bergman comments, the Lord’s Table is for disciples—for all those who will be eating the supper together when the Lord returns.&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The “closed” communion position wrongly restricts the practice on the basis of a doctrinal distinctive—one having little to do with the meaning of the Table itself. Baptism is important, but to be incorrect on a secondary (albeit important) issue is not remotely as unrepentant sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of closed communion sometimes argue for a modified version of this position. Instead, they argue that participation in the Lord’s Supper requires that one already have been baptized, and that since paedobaptism or baptism by a mode other than immersion are by (their) definition not baptisms at all, such believers should not be admitted to the table.&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, this is also problematic. First of all, it assumes facts not in evidence. The New Testament makes no comment on the issue whatsoever, presumably because it was not an issue (regardless of the question of credo- or paedobaptism), leaving one with no direct exegetical warrant for drawing the line here. Moreover, the result is to exclude from the table other believers whose faith in Christ one fully acknowledges and who one is confident will share in the feast at the end of ages—on the basis of a debated interpretive issue, where the New Testament draws no such line. Again, this reduces in no uncertain terms to the idea that doctrinal differences are sufficient for excluding people from the Table, and sets one rapidly on the path to sectarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, advocates of the local-church-only position rightly note that the local church, and especially her shepherds, have a responsibility for the souls of those who partake of the Table. Again, the New Testament is clear that partaking of the talbe in known, unrepentant sin is a cause for judgment; it is likewise clear that churches are as part of the practice of church discipline remove unrepentant members from the table. Since the local church cannot ordinarily know the spiritual condition of a visitor, it is safer to restrict communion only to those about whom the congregation does have knowledge: members. However, this position is similarly hard to sustain from the New Testament. While churches are to remove from membership and access to the table those who are in unrepentant sin, there is no indication of restricting the Table only to those in the local congregation. Moreover, the text most often cited as evidence for this position (1 Cor. 11:28) actually speaks to individuals holding themselves accountable, rather than to churches holding their members accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the New Testament pattern is indeed of baptism, the question once again is whether the issue of baptism is so certain as to warrant this kind of restriction. If, as argued above, there are grounds for holding a credobaptist position only with considerable humility, Christians must likewise take care not to draw too thick a line around other elements of the church’s practice on the basis of baptismal doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="baptism-and-the-local-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Baptism and the Local Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the same arguments applied to the Lord’s Supper have been applied to the issue of church membership, and many of the same concerns are in play. However, many Baptist churches today practice open communion but closed membership, and a number of high-profile Baptist leaders throughout history have advocated for open membership as well as open communion.&lt;a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Baptists have universally argued for a regenerate church membership, and believer’s baptism by immersion has &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; been understood to be a prerequisite for membership, since other forms of baptism have been deemed invalid.&lt;a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, since a local church is not merely a group of believers who happen to come together, but a group united around common affirmations about the nature of the Christian life and the truths Scripture teaches, local churches rightly have a higher bar for membership than merely that a person appears truly to be saved.&lt;a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches should certainly not admit to membership those who affirm their stance on baptism yet continue to refuse it. In cases where the person affirms paedobaptism, though, membership may not be wholly out of bounds—for the same reason that the Lord’s supper is not: the unity of the body of Christ matters enormously. It will &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; be best in such circumstances to direct the individual to another evangelical church in the area that practices paedobaptism.&lt;a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This best reflects the importance and seriousness of baptism. However, there may be times when the best option is to admit such an individual to membership—e.g., in cases where the baptistic church is the evangelical congregation in the area. Baptism is important, but not so important as to leave a regenerate individual or family without fellowship. Until Christ returns and finally sets all doctrines aright, people should gather with those with whom they share core doctrinal affiliations where possible—and be welcomed as brothers and sisters in Christ where it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; possible. Such a practice may, by the grace of God, be used a little to knit together again the fractured body of the church catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="is-baptism-a-church-ordinance" class="level4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Is baptism a church ordinance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believers argue that baptism is specifically a church ordinance, and as such that it should never (or only in very rare circumstances) be carried out outside the church. Since baptism is the believer’s initiation into the church, it is the right only of the church to carry it out.&lt;a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, in nearly every case in the New Testament, the newly baptized believers constituted the first members of the church, and baptism is rarely mentioned outside of “church planting” narratives. In the few cases where baptisms in the local church &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; discussed (1 Cor. 15:29), the content is simply not relevant. Indeed, Jesus himself presided over (but did not participate in) a great many baptisms prior to the formation of the local church, and evidently to a different end than “Christian baptism”—certainly the symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection with Christ remained hidden from those recipients of baptism. As with John’s baptism, this seems to have been a baptism “for repentance from sins” (Mark 1:4). Given the relative silence of Scripture on the subject, it again seems best not to stake out too strong a position on who may and may not baptize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the normal circumstance will be baptism in the context of a local church, because the local church is the home of Christian ministry. However, this is not a normative practice; should a person come to faith in the context of a parachurch ministry, there is no basis for arguing that it is &lt;em&gt;categorically&lt;/em&gt; wrong for the parachurch ministry to perform the convert’s baptism. To be sure, a parachurch ministry that consistently baptizes new converts may run the risk of usurping the church’s role—but in this case, the baptismal practice is a reflection of the problem, not itself the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-age-for-baptism" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Age for Baptism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the credo-baptist position that only those who have made a credible profession of faith should be baptized, the question arises: how old must someone be to offer a profession that the church deems credible and therefore administers baptism? Put negatively, is there an age below which such a baptism would be more akin to paedo- than to credobaptism? Or should any profession of faith be accepted, regardless of the child’s age? There are a number of good arguments in favor of baptizing even very young children after a clear profession of faith.&lt;a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; First, there is no evidence in Scripture for delaying baptism after clear professions of faith: baptism normally followed a profession of faith immediately.&lt;a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Second, delaying baptism as a sort of “litmus test” for baptism implies that something besides repentance and faith in Christ is necessary for salvation. Third, it is not giving false assurance to affirm even a child’s trust in Christ through the gospel—perhaps even to the contrary (Mark 10:13–16). Moreover, the New Testament pattern for confirmation of salvation is always a matter of encouraging those who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; made a profession to hold fast to it (cf. Heb. 2, 4, 6, 10), rather than discouraging people from profession or baptism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also a number of reasons to consider delaying baptism for children.&lt;a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One caution against baptizing young adults who have made a profession is the historic practice of baptistic churches, and that of many baptistic churches outside the United States, where baptism has been and remains a matter for adulthood. Another is the reality that young children, being easily swayed by their parents or peers, might be inclined to make false professions of faith—even apparently sincere ones. Of course, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; profession of faith may be made for the wrong reasons.&lt;a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It is not the church’s job to prevent false profession from being made, but to respond appropriately when a false profession has been made (Matt. 18, 1 Cor. 5). Moreover, as noted above, Scripture is simply silent on the age of non-adults baptized, so making a hard and fast rule is unwarranted. It may nonetheless be wise to baptize only individuals who are judged capable of making their own professions of faith—perhaps those in their early pre-teen years and onward, as judged together by parents and church leaders in each case.&lt;a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="summary" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism is the sign of the New Covenant, and should be applied to the members of that covenant: believers. The preferred mode is immersion, but other modes may be allowed if circumstances demand. Similarly, the church is the ordinary context and her members the normal adminstrators of baptism, but it matters most that a person be baptized by an orthodox Christian in the Trinitarian formula. Those who have been baptized as believers ought not be rebaptized, regardless of mode. Those who have not been baptized as believers may partake of the Lord’s table, but should not ordinarly become members of a Baptist church. In all these things, the people of God ought to rejoice in their participation in the death and resurrection of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lord’s Supper belongs in a distinct category, insofar as it is a means of &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; grace in the Christian life, but it fits in this list as well.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra Thomas White, “What Makes Baptism Valid?” in &lt;em&gt;Restoring Integrity in Baptist Churches&lt;/em&gt;, eds. Thomas White, Jason G. Duesing, and Malcolm B.

&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;See e.g. Luke 11:38, where it is clear the Pharisees were not surprised that Jesus failed to take a whole-body bath; or Mark 7:4, where the same word is used of washing after returning from the market; or Hebrews 6:2, 9:10, where it refers to ritual purification&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the pattern of the early church, as evidenced by the very early “Didache”, which argued for baptism by immersion if possible and by pouring if necessary (&lt;em&gt;Didache&lt;/em&gt; 7).&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be taken as a secondary argument against paedobaptism—a point made to the author and others by Nathan Finn in a number of personal conversations and in several class lectures, 2013–2015.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Norman, 110–111.&lt;a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nearest the New Testament comes to it are: Jesus’ welcome of little children (Mark 10:13–16), Paul’s admonitions to those married to unbelievers for the sake of their spouse and children (1 Cor. 7:12–16), and Paul’s instructions to presumably believing children and their parents (Eph. 6:1–4, Col. 3:20–21) .&lt;a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For constraints of time and space, the author has left aside other views, many of which are both historically and practically significant and deserves serious interaction, but which have in the author’s view less Scriptural warrant (to varying degrees) than the covenant position.&lt;a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also perhaps surprising that in all the controversy stirred up by the Judaizers in the early church, there is no mention of hostility over children being excluded from the New Covenant—a fairly striking change between the two. This is especially so given that the distinction between Old and New Covenants did not preclude the Judaizers from arguing for many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; points of even stronger continuity between Mosaic practice and that of the church—still less Abrahamic practice and that of the church. However, this is another argument from silence and so cannot be taken as strong evidence one way or the other. (Personal conversation with Doug Serven, August 5, 2010.)&lt;a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contested passages in Acts are left aside because, as has been noted, they do not prove what either side claims they do. Lydia believed, and her household was baptized—does this mean her household had no infants in it and everyone in it converted with her? It is impossible to say.&lt;a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra e.g. Nathan Finn, “A Baptist perspective on -re-baptism-”, BRNow.org, posted February 25, 2013, http://www.brnow.org/Opinions/Guest-Columns/February-2013/A-Baptist-perspective-on-re-baptism (accessed March 28, 2015).&lt;a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn16"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, partly begs the question, for it leaves aside the matter of what constitutes a “true Christian church”—certainly a contested issue, and one beyond the scope of this paper. At a minimum, no group which rejects orthodox Trinitarianism and Christology may be included. At most, some major denominations may be excluded. The author is inclined to treat believers’ baptisms even by groups with serious doctrinal problems such as Roman Catholics as valid, however, so long as the specific congregation by which the believer was baptized rightly proclaimed a gospel of repentance from sins and salvation through the finished work of Christ alone.&lt;a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

He is one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; pastors. This makes the task of writing a critical book review somewhat strange. On the one hand, I wanted to write this review as I would any such. On the other hand, I wanted to take care to show respect to a man whom God has used to shepherd me and my family for the past two years since we moved to North Carolina, and whom I regard very highly for his faithfulness in serving the church gathered as First Baptist Church of Durham. I hope I have struck the balance appropriately. And as I hope will become clear, though there were a few places where this book could be stronger, it is nonetheless extraordinarily valuable. I have been challenged and indeed have grown in holiness because of having read it. I commend it to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey: Growing toward Christlikeness&lt;/em&gt;, by Andrew M. Davis, Greenville: Ambassador International, 2014, 480 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="overview" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Davis’ &lt;em&gt;An Infinite Journey&lt;/em&gt; is a careful, thorough, heavy exploration of the doctrine and practice of sanctification in the Christian life. Davis, the long-time pastor of First Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina and an adjunct professor at nearby Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, has clearly dedicated considerable time and consideration to the topic of holiness and growth in the Christian life, and this consideration is on display throughout what is ultimately a very helpful book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis begins by introducing the concepts which permeate the rest of the book: the saving work of God in Christ and the Christian’s lasting dependence on the Holy Spirit. Perhaps surprisingly (at least to the casual reader), he opens not with the topic of sanctification, but with justification, arguing that all real Christian growth must be predicated on a right understanding of the gospel. Thus, he spends some time tracing out the story of salvation, culminating in Christ’s atoning death on the cross and resurrection, and his institution of the church and sending the Holy Spirit to save and then shape the internal lives of Christians throughout the ages. He further argues that all Christians are involved in two “infinite journeys”—the external journey of evangelism and discipleship, and the internal journey of growth in holiness. Both, he notes, are essential for the health of the Christian: to be deficient in either is to demonstrate either ignorance or hard-heartedness toward the things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, Davis turns to a map of the second of these journeys: the internal path of growing Christ-likeness. His thesis is that sanctification is a four-part process, involving a continuous sequence of knowledge, faith, character, and action, each feeding into the next. Knowledge of God produces faith; increasing faith produces Christlike character; a more Christlike character results in more Godward actions; and those Godward actions in turn lead to a greater knowledge of God himself. Davis dedicates a section of the book to each of these ideas, examining in detail Scriptural support for the concept and then examples of the element in the lives of figures in Scripture, especially Christ. Finally, he turns to a section dedicated to application, looking at the knowledge-faith-character-action cycle as a whole in both Scripture and a variety of day-to-day scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="analysis" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davis’ treatment of the doctrines of sanctification is thorough and compelling, most of all because it is drenched in Scripture. Early in the book, Davis explicitly spells out his commitment to the centrality, sufficiency, and authority of Scripture, and the text of the book backs this up. It is common to hear authors affirm the importance of Scripture; it is rare to see it so born out so clearly in their writing. Even apart from the explicit references on nearly every page, the text bears the unmistakable imprint of Davis’ own practice of memorizing books of the Bible. Allusions, near quotes, and implicit references to Scripture appear multiple times on nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Scriptural emphasis leads to the book’s other great strengths. First, Davis makes no point without basing the assertion on Scripture, and he draws on every section of the Bible to demonstrate the importance of each aspect of his map for growth in holiness. Moreover, he follows Scripture’s lead in grounding sanctification in the work of Christ mediated to us by the Holy Spirit. Davis’ emphasis on the work of the Spirit is especially helpful. Though he is by no means a charismatic in the modern sense of the word, it is clear that he is gripped by the reality that sanctification simply does not happen without the work of the Holy Spirit. This is an essential corrective for two kinds of churches: those tempted to ignore the Spirit, and those tempted to ignore all the works of the Spirit apart from those that result in visible signs. Rightly, Davis’ doctrine of sanctification is trinitarian: holy people whole-heartedly worship the Father in Spirit-empowered dependence on the finished work of the Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this Scriptural care allows Davis to navigate the difficult topic of Spirit-dependent human effort that characterizes Biblical sanctification. Because sanctification is the one aspect of salvation in which people are called to work (e.g. in Phil. 2:12), many believers are tempted to treat sanctification as a wholly human endeavor. Davis repudiates this notion, showing again and again that sanctification—like the justification that precedes it and the glorification that will follow it—is ultimately a work of God and one that brings him all glory. No person will be able to claim the credit for their own sanctification before God at the day of judgment. At the same time, he also rejects a Keswickian spirituality (“let go and let God”), even when dressed up as mere gospel dependence. However much in vogue the notion may be that we can do nothing and God does everything for us, it is simply not true. God requires us actively to seek him and his holiness. Davis rightly recognizes both these dangers and charts a course between them. The pursuit of holiness is empowered by the Holy Spirit, and believers must always fix their eyes on the finished work of Christ and the promise of future glory. Yet believers keep their eyes on Christ and rely on the Spirit &lt;em&gt;to work&lt;/em&gt;—not to sit still and trust God to float them toward holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does have a few weaknesses. First, although the book’s length and thoroughness are valuable in many ways, they also make this a difficult sell for anyone who is not already a dedicated reader. Moreover, while much of the length was inevitable in a work this thorough on a topic this complex, the book could be substantially shorter were it edited more carefully. Trimming the lengthy introduction and removing some repetition, unnecessary explanations, and clarifications would make the work stronger as well as shorter and more approachable. Given Davis’ goals—to stir up believers to pursuing holiness—this would be profoundly helpful, as it would allow for the book to be used in a broader variety of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a number of Davis’ references to words’ meanings in Greek are either extraneous or inaccurate. In particular, he regularly committed the so-called etymological fallacy, ascribing meaning to words based on their components rather than their actual use in the language. (This led him several times to disagree with every modern major translation!) He also sometimes referenced English words derived from Greek terms, but in cases where the derivation is irrelevant to the present meaning of the English word (e.g. &lt;em&gt;poem&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;poiema&lt;/em&gt;). Gladly, no major issues in the text hung on these cases. Nonetheless, the misuses were distracting, and since in most cases they were also unnecessary, they actually &lt;em&gt;weakened&lt;/em&gt; the book for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That these are the only significant issues in such a large and thorough book is a significant achievement, and both could readily be addressed in future editions of the work. Taken as a whole, Davis’ book shines. As Davis points out, holiness necessarily entails both knowledge of the things of God and zeal for his glory. The book drips with Davis’ passion for God and his urgent desire that God’s people seek holiness, and it lays out a thoughtful and (most importantly) Scriptural plan for how his people shall become holy. Lord willing, the volume will be a reliable guide to sanctification for the church for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I. The Centrality and Uniqueness of the Incarnation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation of the Son of God is the ground of all Christian hope. It is the “central miracle asserted by Christians.”&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Without the Incarnation, there would be no salvation. Not only would the other aspects of redemption (Christ’s life, teaching, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension) not be possible, but parts of the restoration of humanity hinge on the Incarnation itself. The Incarnation was a unique event in history, with unique theological significance. At no other time has God manifested himself as a human being. The Spirit’s present indwelling of all believers is a direct result of and carries forward the reconciliation of divinity and humanity that occured in the person of Jesus Christ. A healthy church depends on a healthy Christology, for it is only in Christ and by Christ’s Spirit that the church exists—and there can be no healthy Christology without a robust doctrine of the Incarnation. It is in the Incarnation that Jesus the Messiah must be understood: a single person uniting all that it is to be God and all that it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-biblical-affirmations" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Biblical Affirmations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the Gospels opens in a way that emphasizes the unique nature of Jesus Christ. Matthew begins with a genealogy that situates him in the story of Israel, then immediately shows in narrative that from his conception he was also divine (Matt. 1–2, esp. 1:1, 1:23). Mark, ever brief, introduces the Messiah with the astounding words, “Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Luke inverts Matthew’s order: miraculous birth first, genealogy second. He situations Jesus not only in Israel’s story but in humanity’s, tracing his lineage to Adam (Luke 1:26–28, 2:8–38, 3:23–38). John reaches out to Greek philosophy and turns it on its head, proclaiming the coming of the uncreated &lt;em&gt;logos&lt;/em&gt; into creation (John 1:1–18). The sum effect of the gospel-tellers is to emphasize that in Jesus Christ, something profoundly unique had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nowhere are the importance and uniqueness of the Incarnation more evident than in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The anonymous letter emphasizes from its first words the uniqueness of Jesus’ incarnation and ministry (Heb. 1:1–2). It argues that the Incarnation was essential to his roles as priest (2:17–18, 4:15, 5:5–10, 7:26–8:2), destroyer of death (2:14–15), and propitiatory sacrifice (2:9, 7:27, 9:11–28, 10:12–14, 10:19–22). It is not only that Jesus died to save people from their sins, but that he became human and lived to that end and more besides—a consistent theme throughout the New Testament. Thus, Zechariah’s prophecy (Luke 1:76–79) includes salvation from sin, but also light coming into the world, death’s power coming to an end, and peace reigning in the cosmos. Likewise, John couples the Incarnation to the doctrine of adoption (John 1:12). Paul exults in the Incarnation as the grounds of the reconciliation of all things, humanity included (Col 1:19–20). Moreover, he explicitly couples the Messiah’s full humanity to humans being filled in him in turn (Col. 2:9–10)—a theme Peter picks up as well, noting that the saints actually become “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the New Testament affirms that the Incarnation itself was an essential element in the salvation of humanity—not merely as a prerequisite for other parts of Christ’s work. The Incarnation is the means by which human nature is brought once again into fellowship with the Godhead. Christ is the eschatological firstfruits of this restoration. As he is, so will all the saints be in glory: restored to unbroken fellowship between humanity and humanity’s Creator.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-the-theology-of-the-church" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. The Theology of the Church&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the Incarnation has been affirmed by the church throughout her history. The Church Fathers fleshed out the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation over the first four centuries of the history of the church, with various controversies erupting every century.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This work culminated in the lasting affirmations and denials of the Chalcedonian formula.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In fact, nearly every theological controversy in the early church was a Christological controversy, and every such controversy hinged on issues pertaining to the nature of the Incarnation. The Fathers recognized that the details of God’s becoming man were essentials of the faith. The hope of human salvation would be lost entirely if Jesus were not a single person in whom “all the fullness of deity dwells bodily” (Col. 2:9) and who “likewise partook of [flesh and blood]” (Heb. 2:14).&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incarnational thoelogizing did not end in the patristic period; it has remained foundational for further reflection on the natures of God and humanity. Indeed, patristic theology has been influential on nearly every major orthodox theologian since the Reformation—whether directly or mediated by the Reformers. Athanasius’ Christology, with its emphasis on the transformational effect of the Incarnation itself on humanity’s state,&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has proven particularly influential. If advocates of “incarnational” theologies have sometimes pressed this recovery in unhelpful directions (see below), they have also provided a helpful reminder of what God’s becoming man has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; accomplished: the first step of the eschatological transformation of humanity. “The crucified Christ stands in solidarity with humanity, not merely as ane xample of confrontation with the world to be imitated by us &lt;em&gt;but as the reality of new humanity in which we may and must participate&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jesus’ humanity is an essential ingredient in human salvation and in the sanctified life of the believer in the present—the Spirit mediating Christ’s humanity to the believer’s—as well as of a glorified reality in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ii.-in-life-and-ministry" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;II. In Life and Ministry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the importance—indeed, the essential character—of the doctrine of the Incarnation, it is clear that the church must strive to maintain the doctrine. It is insufficent only to affirm it in principle; the church must cherish this reality in practice and protect it from loss. Unfortunately, both in the Western church broadly and in evangelicalism in particular, the centrality and uniqueness of the Incarnation have sometimes been lost through neglect or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="a.-absence" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A. Absence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may first of all fail with regard to its theology of the Incarnation by losing it, whether by doctrinal negation or by simple unobservance. The threat of outright denial of the doctrine has been dangerously common in church history. As noted above, many of the early Christological heresies relted directly to the nature of the Incarnation, and variations on these heresies have continued to arise to the present day. In the Reformation era, for example, the Anabaptist movement included many who affirmed a “heavenly flesh” view in which Jesus was not Mary’s descendant but sent from heaven without human parentage whatsoever—a loss of Christ’s full humanity. More recently, both Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses have affirmed adoptionist views—a loss of Christ’s full deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-supernatural bent of many liberal theologies in the last several centuries has similarly resulted in a rejection of the doctrine of the Incarnation. For many liberals theologians, Jesus was representative of the God-consciousness in us all at its best and adopted by God as a special figure in human history accordingly.&lt;a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Any such outright rejection clearly results in the loss of all that the doctrine entails—not least any hope of real salvation. If Jesus was merely a man who was particularly helpful or holy, he could not redeem other humans. He could at best set others a good example. His death and his resurrection&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can have symbolic power only. They do not save. They inspire or impress at best, and intimidate with their inimitability at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All such views leave those who embrace them without ultimate salvific hope. As Gregory Nazianzen commented during the Arian controversy, “For that which He has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.”&lt;a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though no conservative scholars would actively deny the importance of the Incarnation, their passive neeglect can be nearly as problematic. Sadly, the doctrine receives receives little attention among evangelicals. The crucicentric bent of the evangelical movement has often led to other aspects of the Son’s work being overlooked, so that the Incarnation, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ are all often treated as mere prerequisites for or accessories to his atoning death.&lt;a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even when unintentional, this loss-by-neglect results in real problems in the church’s understanding of God’s work in Christ and humanity. Many of the borderline gnostic tendencies latent in evangelical theology eschatology, and the corresponding spiritualization and de-physicalization of evangelical eschatology, must be laid at least in part at the feet of a deficient theology of the Incarnation. This can only lead to a dimming of future hope—who really wants to be a disembodied spirit somehow strumming a harp forever?—which in turn produces real challenges in the life and faith of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b.-incarnational-theology-a-two-fold-error" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;B. “Incarnational Theology”: A Two-Fold Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church may also err by misapplying its theology of the Incarnation. It has become increasingly common to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: Christians ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to humanity.&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is much to appreciate in this sentiment. It represents an appropriate recognition that humans are God’s image-bearers. It pays heed to the New Testament’s assertion that Christians are representatives of Christ. It takes seriously Paul’s shocking language of “filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions” (Col. 1:24). It rightly points to the synthesis of missionary activity and social activism that represents the best of evangelicalism.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yet for all that, applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this kind of “incarnational” language is a misapplication of Paul’s “body” metaphor for the church, contra the proponents of “incarnational theology”, and notwithstanding Scripture’s many calls to imitate Christ.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Paul uniformly used the language to teach the unity of the people of God—never evangelism. The authors of the New Testament chose other images for proclaiming Christ instead: fishermen (Matt. 4:19), harvest workers (Luke 10:2), servants working in the absence of their master (Matt. 24:45–51), or ambassadors and representatives (2 Cor. 5:20)—to name just a few. At no point, though, does the Bible use the metaphor of the body to describe Christian witness to the world. Nor does it support the idea that ordinary men and women can mediate the presence of God to people. The Incarnation may (and indeed should) prompt evangelism, but this response is not itself “incarnational.” The people of God do not incarnate God the Son, but represent him in other ways. That does not negate the helpful instincts expressed in the incarnational theologizing of the last few years. It simply means that this doctrine can be expressed more accurately and helpfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the church loses a great deal when incarnational theology is about anyone other than Jesus. God becoming man was an astounding and singular event. As Lewis commented, “It was the central event in the history of the Earth—the very thing that the whole story has been about.”&lt;a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When theologians speak of “incarnating” Christ, the sheer shock of the event fades. The focus shifts from the Son’s work in humanity to the human response to the Son. The doctrine of the Incarnation above all ought to lead to worship born of reflection not on human endeavors, but on divine intervention to undo human brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="iii.-conclusion" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;III. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the centrality of the Incarnation and its uniqueness are essential to healthy Christian theology. A robust doctrine of the Incarnation leads to greater worship and deeper future hope. Understood rightly, it leads to deeper faith in the Word who “became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14), and so to more faithful obedience to the gospel. The believer seeks peace and justice and above all that others may know Christ not because the he himself incarnates Christ, but because the Incarnation has produced a radical transformation in his life (and in the lives of all who believe). “Christ gives his sanctified humanity to us, so that we may partake of him and his goodness…. God assumed our umanity in Jesus of Nazareth, healed our humanity with his own being, and gave our sanctified humanity back to us.”&lt;a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The church must therefore take care to protect the doctrine, both from reject or loss through neglect and from misappropriations of the language of incarnation that distract from the work of the Son. The Incarnation itself is essential and central in God’s work in the life of believers. It must never be obscured, diminished, or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="appendix-the-chalcedonian-definition" class="level1"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Appendix: The Chalcedonian Definition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For the synod is opposed to those who presume to rend asunder the mystery of the Incarnation into a double Sonship, and it deposes from the priesthood those who dare to say that the Godhead of the Only-begotten is passible; and it withstands those who imagine a mixing or confusion of the two natures of Christ; and it drives away those who erroneously teach that the form of a servant which he took from us was of a heavenly or some other substance; and it anathematizes those who feign that the Lord had two natures before the union, but that these were fashioned into one after the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore, following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, the same perfect in Godhead, the same perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man, the same consisting of a reasonable soul and a body, of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, the same of one substance with us as touching the manhood, like us in all things apart from sin; begotten of the Father before the ages as touching the Godhead, the same in the last days, for us and for our salvation, born from the Virgin Mary, the Theotokos, as touching the manhood, one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being in no way abolished because of the union, but rather the characteristic property of each nature being preserved, and concurring into one Person and one subsistence (ὑπόστασις), not as if Christ were parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten God, Word, Lord, Jesus Christ; even as the Prophets from the beginning spoke concerning him, and our Lord Jesus Christ instructed us, and the Creed of the Fathers has handed down to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resurrection is of course customarily denied in such theologies as well.&lt;a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregory Nazianzen &lt;em&gt;Epistle CI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cf. the reduction of all of Christ’s works to aspects of the atonement in Leon Morris, &lt;em&gt;The Atonement: Its meaning and significance&lt;/em&gt; (Downers Grove: Inter-Varsity Press, 1983); and see the similar critique in Ross Clifford and Philip Johnson, &lt;em&gt;The Cross Is Not Enough: Living as Witnesses to the Resurrection&lt;/em&gt; (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 2012).&lt;a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes (36–38) rightly notes that imitating Christ is an essential element in the Christian life, but makes numerous hermeneutical missteps in his attempt to extend those texts to justify an “incarnational” theology.&lt;a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
