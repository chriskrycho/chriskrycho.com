&lt;p&gt;“Level up your &lt;code&gt;.filter&lt;/code&gt; game” gives you a reason to use some standard FP tools—currying, higher-order functions, composition—in your ordinary work. It’s pitched at working JS developers. It gives a real-world example of wanting to filter search results based on user input. It shows the utility of defining a bunch of small functions which can fit together like LEGO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters are an essential part of JavaScript development. Whether you’re sorting out bad data from an API response or responding to user interactions, there are countless times when you would want a subset of an array’s values. I hope this overview helped with ways that you can manipulate predicates to write more readable and maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commend the piece to you not so much for the explanation of how to use JavaScript’s &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.filter&lt;/code&gt; effectively (though it has some good suggestions that way!) but &lt;em&gt;primarily&lt;/em&gt; as a great example of the kind of pedagogy we need a lot more of to demonstrate the value of functional programming in ordinary, day-to-day development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are focused on introductory programming education at a high-school and collegiate level — what is often called “CS 1” and “CS 2” (roughly, the first year of college). Pyret is being actively used in everything from high-schools to upper-level collegiate courses, giving us a tight feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even in that setting there are differences of opinion about what needs to be taught. Some believe inheritance is so important it should be taught early in the first semester. We utterly reject this belief (as someone once wisely said, “object-oriented programming does not scale down”: what is the point of teaching classes and inheritance when students have not yet done anything interesting enough to encapsulate or inherit from?). Some have gone so far as to start teaching with Turing Machines. Unsurprisingly, we reject this view as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do not take a dogmatic stance on is exactly how early state and types should be introduced. Pyret has the usual stateful operations. We discussed this at some length, but eventually decided an introduction to programming must teach state. Pyret also has optional annotations, so different instructors can, depending on their preference, introduce types at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;delighted&lt;/em&gt; to see work on languages like Dr. Racket and Pyret, and the more so because the teams behind both have been willing to set aside many of the dogmas of how CS has been taught and actually do &lt;em&gt;pedagogical research&lt;/em&gt;. Also: OOP is a useful tool, but I’m with them: treating inheritance as a first-semester concept is… nutty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole &lt;a href="http://www.pyret.org/pyret-code/"&gt;“Why Pyret?”&lt;/a&gt; page is worth reading if you have any interest in programming languages or teaching software development and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Christian in the world of podcasting—I have both a “two dudes talking” show (Winning Slowly) and also a “one dude talking with maybe a brief musical intro and outro” show (New Rustacean)—I found much to agree with, but also much to clarify and a few things to disagree with…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a set of theses on podcasting as a medium. Some of these are obvious; none are intended to be tendentious. Some of them warrant further explanation—for which, see below….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which, &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/theses-on-podcasting/"&gt;32 theses (and another ~3,000 words)&lt;/a&gt; on the constraints and challenges of podcasting as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: the format of this particular piece is heavily inspired by Jacobs’ own &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-for-disputation/"&gt;“79 Theses on Technology. For Disputation.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, we’ll tackle the small, easy problem of &lt;em&gt;systemic force and individual agency&lt;/em&gt; this season on &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/5.01/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.01: A Ph.D.-Level Math Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Structures and systems, agency and individuals: three axes (and a sub-axis) for thinking about the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce our system for thinking about the “structure/agency” or “systems and individuals” problem: how do the systems and structures of our lives shape us? How do we shape them? How free are we, and where are the places where more freedom is good, and the places where it might actually be bad? How do we confront the structural issues we face, or strengthen and preserve the good systems we do have in place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/5.01/"&gt;Listen to the whole thing!&lt;/a&gt; And then &lt;a href="mailto:hello@winningslowly.org?subject=5.01:%20A%20Ph.D.-Level%20Math%20Problem"&gt;tell us&lt;/a&gt; what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reading John J. O’Keefe and R. R. Reno’s Sanctified Vision for the independent study on hermeneutics and theological method I am doing this summer. I have found the book fairly helpful overall, and think the authors are right to commend the church Fathers as models for Biblical interpretation in many ways. The authors do good (albeit somewhat tendentious) work arguing for whole-Bible/“intensive reading” strategies and the validity of typology as part of theological method. When they come to allegory, though, their argument almost immediately goes off the rails with a deeply misguided interpretation of The Lord of the Rings….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/misreading-tolkien-hermeneutics-allegory-lord-rings/"&gt;over at Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As is, all you’re doing is propping up some of the nastiest, most anti-consumer companies in the country and sustaining monopolies and duopolies, supposedly in the name of “free markets”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.b. This isn’t intrinsically a partisan issue. It’s become one, but mostly because Republicans have felt compelled to do the bidding of the telecom industry for… reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing worse than a government monopoly is a &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Republicans wanted to push for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-loop_unbundling"&gt;local loop unbundling&lt;/a&gt; in place of net neutrality, &lt;em&gt;almost everyone&lt;/em&gt; would be for it. (The exception: telecom companies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription models for software can be valuable and reasonable—but the providers have to justify them with product to match. Avid isn’t, and hasn’t been. I’ve no doubt they’re continuing to profit in the short term, but this will no doubt erode their market position and waste an amazing product in the long term. Greed destroys good things.&lt;/p&gt;

This doesn’t excuse riots, but it sure as heck &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; them. Baltimore is broken, but primarily in a massive system of abuse. Yes, pray for peace.

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want a back door,” Rogers said. “I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks. Big locks….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogers suggests the adoption of “front door” access will allow for essential security measures while keeping data safe from hackers or an outside attack. But opponents of the idea note that even broken into pieces, a master digital key creates security flaws. “There’s no way to do this where you don’t have unintentional vulnerabilities,” Donna Dodson, chief cyber­security adviser at the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technologies, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit is absolutely true. The government basically wants to make sure it can spy on anyone, any time it wants. That’s a bad, bad plan.&lt;/p&gt;

The review proper concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Echoes of Eden says all the right things. Barrs has provided a healthy, sound theology of the arts, reiterating and synthesizing the helpful work of Schaeffer, Lewis, Tolkien, O’Connor, and Dostoevsky. What is more, his survey of English literature grounds that theology in concrete examples we can follow. This is a solid book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was a bit more to say about this, because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one thing it lacked, though: beauty of its own. As Barrs himself says, “A book that is not well-written, no matter how compelling the story is, will not be reread multiple times” (114). I doubt I will read Echoes of Eden again, because this is true for non-fiction as well. Form matters. It may not be quite true that the way we say things is just as important as what we say—better to say the truth boringly than a lie splendidly—but it comes a close second. The truth is beautiful, and we should always aim to present it beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find the rest interesting! &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/speak-truth-beauty-review-echoes-eden/"&gt;Take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note: I actually meant to have this reviewed about 18 months ago. I got buried in Greek III and it totally slipped my mind! Gladly, the folks at Crossway who sent me the book were understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

I enjoy Kindle and iPad, but I still love books best. Turns out I’m not alone… and there might just be reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/reading-on-screen-versus-paper/"&gt;Brandon Keim at Wired:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper books were supposed to be dead by now. For years, information theorists, marketers, and early adopters have told us their demise was imminent. Ikea even redesigned a bookshelf to hold something other than books. Yet in a world of screen ubiquity, many people still prefer to do their serious reading on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count me among them. When I need to read deeply—when I want to lose myself in a story or an intellectual journey, when focus and comprehension are paramount—I still turn to paper. Something just feels fundamentally richer about reading on it. And researchers are starting to think there’s something to this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the premiere of Darren Aronofsky’s &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, and with it a (predictable) storm of controversy from the evangelical community. Reviews have ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2014/03/31/drowning-in-distortion-darren-aronofskys-noah/"&gt;predictably critical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/churchofthemasses/2014/03/the-utter-embarrassing-mess-of-noah-and-why-everybody-is-lying-about-it/"&gt;outright disdain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil"&gt;hostile readings&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/noah.html?paging=off"&gt;strongly (though not unreservedly) positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://convergemagazine.com/noah-film-12561/"&gt;more restrained restrained affirmation&lt;/a&gt; of the film on &lt;a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/noah"&gt;aesthetic and spiritual&lt;/a&gt; grounds to especially measured &lt;a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx"&gt;theological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/stars-strange-review-noah/"&gt;artistic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the responses spanned exactly the range one would expect from the evangelical community, which is itself deeply divided on the purpose, value, and meaning of the arts—decades of conversation on the topic notwithstanding. &lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt; works as a sort of theological-artistic Rorschach test. We seem to find it in what we expect given its origins and our disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than offer another review (which would add nothing to the conversation at this point), or decry once again the predictable evangelical response to the arts, or even critique reviews with which I disagreed, I thought it might be useful instead to ask where we stand today and point to a few places we might grow from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll find &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/noah-theological-aesthetic-rorschach-test/"&gt;the rest of the piece&lt;/a&gt; salient and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

It shows the influence of patristic thought in the best way possible, and also demonstrates a great handle on the bigger picture of salvation history in the whole of the canon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few salient quotes. First, on moral and physical perfection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection was not the creation’s natural state, but its intended destiny (and salvation is not a ‘rebooting’ of creation to its primary state, but the restoring of creation to the future that God originally intended for it)….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With perfection, our wills will be so capable of apprehending our good that we will no longer be capable of willing to do evil, not by virtue of some external compulsion, but by virtue of mature wills and natures and their appropriate mutual correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then from the conclusion, which I positively &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Christ’s obedience is not about ‘innocence’ but about ‘perfection’. Christ brings humanity to the height and fullness of its divinely intended moral stature. He gives us, not merely innocence or obedience, but full maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, humanity was always intended to die and rise again to a more glorious form of life. Christ death and resurrection achieves this destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as the last Adam, Christ will pacify and tame the entire creation, ruling until every enemy is placed under his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, as we are in Christ, the bad character of death is minimized. We are not unclothed to be left naked, but in order to be more fully clothed, to have death swallowed up in life. We are still subject to the hostile attacks of the world and to the possibility of death within it, but Christ is the Tree of Life and we have unrestricted access to him. Death is no longer the alienating power that it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great read, start to finish. &lt;a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2014/04/08/death-before-the-fall/"&gt;“Death Before the Fall”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been common these past few years to speak of “incarnational theology” as a way of describing the Christian mission to the world: we ought to “incarnate” Christ to the world as Christ “incarnated” the Godhead to us. There is much to appreciate in this sentiment…. Yet for all that, I think that applying the language of incarnation to believers is a serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Incarnation matters, and it matters as more than a means of getting Jesus to the cross so that he could die for our sins. We evangelicals too often reduce everything to penal substitutionary atonement. Yes, the atonement is incredible and amazing. It is one of the central affirmations and joys of the Christian faith: our sins are paid for! Glory to God! But Jesus did more than that, and he is worthy of yet more praise. He did not stop at paying the price for our sins while leaving our bodies subject to corruption. He did not content himself with performing a judicial act while leaving our wills broken, certain to turn again to the same sin that led to our death in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/god-become-man-richer-theology-incarnation/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the best thing I’ve written so far this year; I hope you find it stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run in certain Facebook circles, you’ve likely already read that North Korean leader Kim Jung-un has called for the execution of 33 North Korean Christians. According to the widely circulated reports, these 33 people were detained after it was discovered they had ties to Kim Jung-wook, a South Korean missionary whose arrest for religious activity last year has made international headlines….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: No one can verify this call for executions actually took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of journalism done right, and of how Christians ought to carry ourselves in the public square. It matters whether our facts are right or not— even when the “message” might be right either way. The &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com/33-christians-north-korea-really-execution/"&gt;whole thing&lt;/a&gt; is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that our country will try to combat generational poverty and all its great harms by investing heavily in early childhood intervention. We already see signs of the State moving towards such programs with President Obama’s 2013 State of the Union address and Mayor de Blasio’s expanded pre-K. Tragically and despite enormous costs, de Blasio’s pre-K initiative in New York will most likely have very modest results, particularly since it begins intervention at age four, so late in the child’s mental development. The question for the church is, will we allow the state to take the initiative, or will we take up this task and engender the kind of deep, redemptive healing that the state can only dream of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should (1) &lt;a href="http://www.canonandculture.com/combatting-generational-poverty-through-early-childhood-intervention/"&gt;read the rest of this piece&lt;/a&gt; and (2) read lots more by him and other sharp guys at his homebase &lt;a href="http://christandpopculture.com"&gt;Christ and Pop Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Korea tyrant Kim Jong-un has reportedly ordered that 33 Christians believed to be working alongside South Korean Baptist missionary Kim Jung-wook be put to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.b. the source is Breitbart, which I usually take with a very large grain of salt—but this is not exactly surprising for Kim Jong-un or North Korea, so it is deserving of further investigation and prayer in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study by Ookla Speedtest, the U.S. ranks a shocking 31st in the world in terms of average download speeds. The leaders in the world are Hong Kong at 72.49 Mbps and Singapore on 58.84 Mbps. And America? Averaging speeds of 20.77 Mbps, it falls behind countries like Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;
