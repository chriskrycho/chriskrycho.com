However, I ran into a fairly obvious problem today: word counts goals don’t handle &lt;em&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; well. This morning I picked up a piece I started a few months ago, which I’d like to finish and publish by the end of the month. After ten minutes of working on it, I had written some new words… but there were 40 fewer words than when I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected. Good writing requires editing. This shows the downside of word count goals quite clearly, though: progress on good writing &lt;em&gt;often&lt;/em&gt; entails the word count going &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this little project, I’m fine with it. The point is to get all these muscles moving again. Most days this month, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; working on new materials. Hitting my goal won’t be hard even with editing involved. Still: a reminder that &lt;i&gt;time spent writing each day&lt;/i&gt; might end up being a better metric in the long run for these kinds of goals than &lt;i&gt;word count&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
