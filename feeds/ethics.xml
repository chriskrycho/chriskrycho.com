It does us all a great disservice, not for what it says but for what it leaves unsaid and the ways it misleads us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I most recently ran into the &lt;em&gt;capitalism&lt;/em&gt; variant of the phrase in the influential 1995 essay “The Californian Ideology,” by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron. The text is littered with the phrase; if you took the essay at face value you would conclude that at least in the minds of Barbrook and Cameron capitalism had transformed from a system and structure into a demon possessing and directing the culture they dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not opposed to &lt;a href="http://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/matthewloftus/2017/04/27/new-gods-old-demons/" title="Matthew Loftus: “New Gods, Old Demons”"&gt;such readings of the world&lt;/a&gt; in principle; I think they may even &lt;a href="http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2017/04/principalities-powers-and-technical-boy.html" title="Alan Jacobs: “principalities, powers, and the technical boy”"&gt;get certain important things right&lt;/a&gt; that we too often overlook in our “disenchanted” modernity. If people want to talk of Capitalism and Marxism and Media and Liberalism and Technologism and The Beltway and The Kremlin and so on as capital-P Powers—if people want to think about the ways in which there may be real spiritual realities at work behind some of the things we take for granted—well, as the millennials say, &lt;em&gt;I am so here for that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not how Barbrook and Cameron meant it. Nor is it how most people mean the phrase when they toss it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they mean, instead, is something like this: &lt;em&gt;People act differently in different systems and structures; the system and structure of capitalism [or liberalism or fundamentalism or…] leads people to act in [this way that I think is bad].&lt;/em&gt; It is, in other words, shorthand for an idea most of us can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That idea is important, too: people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act differently in different systems and structures. What’s more, when a given structure is pervasive, it can be difficult to resist or reject, or even to consider that it should be resisted or rejected. This idea is so important that &lt;a href="http://stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen Carradini&lt;/a&gt; and I dedicated all of &lt;a href="https://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html"&gt;Winning Slowly Season 5: Structure and Agency&lt;/a&gt; to the ins and outs of systems and structures, good and bad alike; the limits of individual action in the face of systemic pressure; and the ways we ought to leverage good systems and dismantle bad systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. As much as this shorthand captures something important, it also &lt;em&gt;obscures&lt;/em&gt; something important: it is &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; who act differently under those different structures, and &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; who set up systems in the first place and maintain them afterward. This is not to dismiss the tendency of systems to perpetuate themselves, or to ignore the reality of . Rather, it is to remind us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; systems come to be (people created them because they seemed in some way good to them), &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; they are made of (people continuing to do what seems in some way good to them), and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they are hard to dismantle (because many people’s self-interest is aligned with maintaining existing institutions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to think and act as if individual agency is all that matters, and this is fallacious. People &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; act differently in different systems and structures, for good and for ill. Capitalism, as a system and structure, serves as an environment in which enormous gains in productivity have been possible; but it also serves an environment where people reduce others (and themselves) to their productivity. “Liberalism,” as a system and structure, serves as an environment where many important gains in human liberties have grown up; but it also serves as an environment where the good of liberty has at times grown cancerous and indeed metastasized until that the will of the individual is dangerously (and nonsensically) totalized. Contrast how people live and think and act in capitalist or liberal contexts with feudal or tribal contexts (to pick just two of the many contrasts we could) and you will see very, very different things. Systems matter; we cannot erase their impact on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is also possible to talk and act as if the structure, the system, is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. This is the mistake the shorthand “what capitalism does” leads us to. Flip the emphasis in the previous paragraph: the environments of capitalism and liberalism matter, but &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; continue to act in those environments. More than that, people continue to transform the structures and systems they inhabit, often in startling ways. Half a century ago, it would have been laughable to suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com" title="Apple"&gt;the most profitable corporation in the world&lt;/a&gt; would also be among those most assiduously pursuing environmental responsibility and stewardship. People’s continuous pressure, as well as the ascent to not only economic but also cultural leadership of people who care about this has changed capitalism in a good way. Social pressure on businesses has plenty of downsides, too, in our internet-rage-storm era; and there is much to critique about the ways that business leaders have come to dominate culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point, though, is that systems and structures are more malleable than the shorthand credits them, and so we would do well to remember the limitations of the shorthand and indeed largely to abandon it unless we are often in the habit of qualifying it. It is too sloppy. Throw it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if not that—shorthands &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; useful after all—then clarify often. Talk instead about structures and systems and people’s ability to change them and indeed to throw them out. Speak less often of “what capitalism does” and more often of what capitalism makes easy and what it makes hard, what avenues living in liberalism opens up and what it blinds us to, what virtues and what vices fundamentalism might inculcate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you want to have a conversation about Powers, have at it.)&lt;/p&gt;

I had a thought this morning, and it was solid. But I was not in a spot where I could write it down (whether in a notebook or in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;). The frustration I feel at this is hard to express, but here I am trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is such a frustrating experience that I &lt;em&gt;keenly&lt;/em&gt; remember the experience happening to me once before—back in 2016, for a post I have not yet finished writing because I continually find it &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; me. And since I cannot remember today’s good idea, and haven’t finished the last good idea, I’ll just share the notes I wrote down back in March 2016 about that idea in hopes that either I will actually run with them sooner rather than later, or that the act of putting it out there in this brief form will be enough to allow me to let it go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American conservatives point to previous eras as if our nation were less sinful, less blemished then. It was not. It was wretched in different ways—but no less wicked than now. Centuries of slavery, and of Jim Crow, &lt;em&gt;are not lesser sins than today’s sexual ills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservatives have too often elided these essential questions: Whose “better” past? And in what sense “better”? It may have been less sexually perverse, but how is that “better” when it entailed at the same time massive oppression of whole groups of people—especially because that oppression was so often at the hands of people claiming the name of Christ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal to unpack there, and I continue to find it more than I am really &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty of interesting things have been said about the movie (which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good), but one I’ve not considered before is the extent to which the day Bill Murray’s character lives (and lives and lives and lives) is a product of choices he made the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loudest (though least important) of these earlier choices in the film is the alarm clock which wakes Murray’s character every day. He starts the day on the same radio station to the same vapid announcements because of choices he is powerless to affect in any way throughout the film: whatever he had done the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quieter (but much more important) versions of that are that the people in the town are who they are, and Murray’s own character is who and what he is, because of choices now out of all of their hands. The past is fixed to us, and in very real ways, we are who we are and live the lives we live now because of things we have already done (and things others have already done) and which we cannot change. That goes for it all: good, bad, and indifferent. And so the other side of the coin is that the choices we make &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; similarly mark our courses for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing particularly profound or novel in any of that, of course. It was just something that was made a bit more striking in thinking about the predicament of a man caught in a time loop, living the exact same day over and over and therefore more particularly confronted with the choices that had led him to that specific day. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt;, I wonder, &lt;em&gt;would I think of yesterday’s choices if I had to live today over and over again?&lt;/em&gt; And likewise: &lt;em&gt;What of tomorrow and the choices I make today?&lt;/em&gt;—even just at that simplest level of setting an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a strange little thought to start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 07:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.chriskrycho.com,2018-02-23:/2018/a-strange-little-thought.html</guid><category>ethics</category><category>film</category></item><item><title>Against Doing What Comes Naturally.</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/against-doing-what-comes-naturally.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Twice, recently, I have found myself needing to start over—essentially from scratch—on something I had written. One was a tech talk for work, another my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/2017-in-review-my-goals.html" title="2017 In Review: My Goals"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; post on how we chose a new church after we moved across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both pieces suffered from an overabundance of combativeness. Or: I was kind of a jerk in the first drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about them this morning, I noted that in both cases my tendency was to write in a posture that mixed defensiveness with hostility to an existing structure. In both cases, that hostility might actually be well-deserved—but there are times and places for everything, including polemic, and the more I (separately) chewed on both of these pieces, the more I realized that I didn’t want to have an argument. In these cases, at least, I don’t want to &lt;em&gt;punch&lt;/em&gt; the views I disagree with, so much as gently nudge them out of the way while showing a more excellent way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runs up against one of my deepest-seated tendencies. I am passionate about teaching, about showing a better way, about correcting and fixing ills in the world. I also find a good argument wonderfully sharpening to the way I think—tracing out differences, finding the weaknesses in my own views and either tightening them up or abandoning them as appropriate, understanding other views more clearly… Those are good passions in many ways, but like all good passions they can go awry very easily. In my case, they can lead me to treat &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; like an argument, and to go after everything that seems amiss to me with the same kind of knock-it-down-with-a-battering-ram approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last fifteen years, I have been learning &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to verbally hammer at problems (whether in person or in writing). I have slowly learned to listen carefully and try to understand why someone holds the view they do, even when I still think their view is wrong. I have seen firsthand that people’s surface statements and their deepest-held beliefs alike often derive from experiences that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; obvious on the surface. Their struggles are not necessarily apparent. Their histories certainly are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also slowly learned that a nudge here and a nudge there can often be both more effective and—more importantly—&lt;em&gt;kinder&lt;/em&gt; than trying to shove people where I think they ought to be. Even when I’m right about where they ought to be! And my judgments of such things, I have also too-slowly learned, are far less than perfect—which should temper the vigor with which I sally forth to do battle for those judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: there are times for rebuke. There are times to say, “This view you hold [about software development, or Christianity, or financial practices, or whatever else]? It’s &lt;em&gt;dead wrong&lt;/em&gt;.” But not all the time. Even though it’s what’s “natural” for me, even though it’s what feels right sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we have to fight our strongest instincts. No matter how natural something feels, it can be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. That is certainly so for me when I get combative about something I’m passionate about. It’s the right response… &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt;. Nearly all of the time, I need to be quieter, gentler, more patient, more understanding, and less interested in winning a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I did in 2017 that I’m most proud of (and which I get &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; utility from every day at work) is building &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt;, a library implementing &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; types in TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: if you’re about to tune out because this sounds technical, don’t. You can understand everything important in this post without understanding a thing about TypeScript or these particular types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; special about that library compared to any of the others in the space which already do the same thing. It makes its own &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth/blob/master/README.md#why-not" title="Comparisons with Folktale and Sanctuary"&gt;design tradeoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which are slightly &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from others, and it has what I think are &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org"&gt;best-in-class docs&lt;/a&gt;, but mostly it’s comparable to the others. Still, it’s &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, and it fits that particular niche in terms of design tradeoffs pretty well in my view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just saw the public work on that, you’d have first heard of it &lt;em&gt;at the earliest&lt;/em&gt; when I pushed the first commit to GitHub on September 21, 2017. But the roots go much, much further back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I just found a related bit of work dating all the way back to January 10, 2017: an early attempt to see if I could directly reimplement Rust’s Result and Option types in TypeScript, in the early days of my adoption of TypeScript.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That initial spike didn’t work—and I mean that literally; I didn’t yet have enough of a handle on TypeScript’s type system to get it to actually compile! But it was the first of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; (mostly very brief) swings I took at it over the course of the year. The culmination of those repeated stabs at the problem was True Myth, with its polish, test coverage, and very considered design tradeoffs.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But none of that would have happened without the better part of a year of experimenting along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more: even that January spike wasn’t the real start of True Myth. I have code in our codebase (code we’re finally mostly done replacing with True Myth!) that was an early attempt to capture these same basic ideas in plain-old JavaScript—code that dates to March 2016!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: do not be discouraged when your own work seems to take a long time, or when you see others produce what seem to be fully-formed projects all in a rush. Always, our best work stands on a foundation—of ideas simmering over time, of previous attempts that got partway, of previous outright &lt;em&gt;failures&lt;/em&gt;—and all of that is “underground,” out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat amusingly to me in retrospect, I’d switched from Flow to TypeScript on our codebase at Olo as my final act of 2016.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that we hit a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sweet spot with the design here: it works well as idiomatic JavaScript &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; supports nice functional idioms and I think it just feels nice to use &lt;em&gt;in JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;—not just as a port of ideas from Haskell, Scala, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I have a bunch of mostly-unformed thoughts, and I want to write, and the two come out here, together, in the next few minutes before I start my workday proper (because I stayed up late last night working on open source software and got up late accordingly, and so have a great deal less of &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="“Knowing Your Rhythms”"&gt;my normally-allocated writing time&lt;/a&gt; available today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source software is a very strange place, and the dynamics of it favor those of us who already have well-paying jobs and lots of flexibility in our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing. It means that anyone who wants to use open-source contribution as a gauge of someone’s fitness to work is making a pretty foolish decision, though: they’re inherently cutting off a whole sector—dare I say it, a whole &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;—of people who simply do not (and, barring being given a pretty surprising break, will never) have that kind of stability and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad for meaningful discussion. I follow both &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/noahpinion"&gt;Noah Smith (@noahpinion)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lymanstoneky"&gt;Lyman Stone (@lymanstoneky)&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re both extremely interesting follows, and they’re both clearly &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; smart and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well-informed, and in their off-Twitter writing they both do a good job of fairly representing others’ views and interacting with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, their arguments are a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not specific to Smith and Stone. This is Twitter in one pair of interlocutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously: stop tweeting and start blogging again, if you have an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; to make rather than just a pithy, one-off observation or a link to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a surprising amount of writing done in 5 minutes, if you’re willing to just word-vomit. (This whole post, start to finish, took me 12 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more poetry; more rich, good fiction; more rich, good nonfiction. I’ve read a lot of nonfiction in the last five years, but I wouldn’t call most of it &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt;. Most of it—most of my seminary reading, that is—was &lt;em&gt;just okay&lt;/em&gt;; very little of it engaged deeply with thought critical of its own perspective. (Major exceptions: David Koyzis’ really excellent &lt;em&gt;Political Visions and Illusions&lt;/em&gt;, Alvin Plantinga’s &lt;em&gt;Where the Conflict Really Lies&lt;/em&gt;, and of course St. Athanasius’ &lt;em&gt;On the Incarnation&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I find that my own writing is far sharper, clearer, and better when I’m drawing &lt;em&gt;widely&lt;/em&gt; and from &lt;em&gt;deep wells&lt;/em&gt;. Widely, because I find that too much time in the same spot overly narrows my focus, whether that is apologetics or programming languages. From deep wells because, frankly, there is too much out there which warrants nothing more than a skim &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

But over the last few years I’ve been thinking about, and I’m increasingly concerned about, the ways that we are shaped by our use of technology. We could generalize this discussion to all sorts of things, and I’m sure I will (though I’m also pretty sure you’d just be better off reading &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com" title="The Frailest Thing"&gt;L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;, whom I’ve linked in this connection before). But for today, I want to just zoom in and think about this question specifically in the context of technologies we employ in the context of the Christian faith. (If you’re not a Christian, I suspect much of what I have to say here will still ring true, so don’t run off just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using apps to manage my list of tasks to get through for a long time: first &lt;a href="https://todoist.com"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;. So as I’ve been wanting to develop more rigor around my prayer life, and in particular to make sure I pray for certain people and the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; difficult circumstances they’re currently facing, it was natural to go looking for an app to manage that. And although “There’s an app for that” is no longer an Apple marketing campaign, is truer than ever it was when it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an Apple marketing campaign. So there are a lot of prayer apps on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I snagged an app both my wife and another woman I really respect have found helpful as a tool for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; prayer lives. And it’s been sitting there unused for a month. I launched the app once. I’ve had an item in Things for that whole time to populate it. But I haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole time the app has been sitting there on my homescreen, I’ve been stuck on this question: &lt;em&gt;How does this tool form me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the broader question that’s nagged at me for quite some time. How are we shaped and formed by our use of, and indeed our &lt;em&gt;dependence on&lt;/em&gt;, the tools we employ to remember things, to form habits, etc.? What happens if the tool goes away? Nick Carr has written fairly extensively&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about the effects on concentration and memory; but those merely point to a broader concern: what kind of people do we wish to form ourselves to be? And are our tools helping or hurting us in that aim? For our tools &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; form us, no less than we form them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not really about this (or any particular) prayer app. And I certainly don’t think it’s &lt;em&gt;inherently wrong&lt;/em&gt; to use a prayer app, or anything of the sort. But it nags at me. Will I truly learn to be disciplined about prayer, or will I simply learn to be further hooked on alerts from my pocket supercomputer? If I end up praying faithfully for people, but also end up more distracted, more reliant on this little slab of metal and glass, less engaged with my family, what is the net on that? It is, at a minimum, not a clear &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of these concerns are specific to prayer apps. I have been using a digital Bible for most of a decade now. I use a pomodoro timer to help my maintain my discipline and concentration throughout my work. I use &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; for keeping a log of what I’ve done for work every day,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and for jotting down writing ideas. This very post started out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.chriskrycho.com/images/bear-blog-idea.png" title="Bear app" alt="The note in Bear that was the germination of this blog post" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The note in Bear that was the germination of this blog post&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a digital notes app is not the same as disciplining myself to remember things. But the same concerns apply, of course, to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; aids we employ. Using a digital notes app is not identical to using a physical notebook as a place for jotting down ideas—but they’re more similar to each other than they are to &lt;em&gt;not using a tool at all&lt;/em&gt;. Both have a cost in effective, &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; memory of those ideas. On the other hand, they also have the benefit of helping us remember more ideas, and more clearly, than we would otherwise, and also of freeing us to think on and remember &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also points to another of the fundamental challenges in evaluating the tools we use. We’re accustomed to thinking of many things—these days, mostly computers and computerized things—as technological and other things as sort of “natural” and “untechnological.” But of course, literally everything we do is unnatural and technological in many ways—too many to count; but for a start consider that clothing is not &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt;; it is a technology! So are books. So are forks and cups and plates. So are journals, and pencils, and pens. And those technologies all shape and form us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribbling notes in a paper journal day after day will change your body and your mind; you will have calluses from holding the pen, and will know that your ideas are found in that journal. The loss of a journal filled with sketches of ideas might become a horrifying thought, because in writing down one’s ideas, one intentionally lets the paper do the work that one’s memory might have done otherwise. &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; of those things—though by no means all—are just the same whether using a digital journal or a paper one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in my own experience, some of the important differences include the way it feels mentally to think with a pen vs. to think with a keyboard. (I use the phrase “think with” here to emphasize what it is we’re doing either way: using the tool to help us think as well as to remember.) That difference is, so far as I can tell in considering my own thinking, not just one of &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, either: I write different things, in different ways, with pen and paper than I do with a keyboard. I’m a much better poet with pen and paper, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those differences do not void the core they share: they are memory-replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for nothing have people worried about the effects of new technologies on memory for millennia. And it is worth note: those who thought the advent of each kind of new information technology would come with costs were not wrong. Literate cultures seem inevitably to lose the power of oral recall. Members of illiterate cultures can often accomplish feats of memory that astound members of literate cultures, because they do not have books to offload their stories and histories to. The only way to keep them—and we value stories, so we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; find a way to keep them—is to commit them to memory, and deeply. The tradeoff with books is real. The tradeoff with a physical journal is real. The tradeoff with the internet is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we will be formed by the technologies we employ—at least, unless you plan to go back to living naked, surviving off of whatever you can manage to collect with your bare hands and eat raw (fire, too, is technology, after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To narrow it further: the question is which specific shapings we find needful in our specific contexts. Perhaps, if there is a problem, it is not with a prayer app individually, or a todo app individually, or a notes app individually, but with offloading &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our mental tasks to a smartphone. No harm done in using a prayer app; but maybe write your to-do list on paper; and perhaps find something, anything at all, to simply &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; to do every day.&lt;/p&gt;

Two examples of that challenge caught my attention this evening, ironies I noticed in reading the very same article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=8248"&gt;“How smartphones hijack our minds”&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Carr explores much of the evidence for ways that use of smartphones can have seriously negative effects on our thinking in ways that are both pernicious (because we usually do not notice them consciously) and pervasive (in that they happen simply by dint of the &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of the devices). It’s a good article, and I commend it you as a helpful summary of a lot of the most current research on attention, smartphones, and the like; you should read it and think about how you use your phone.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first irony was that I read that article… on my smartphone. As indeed I read &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; of Nick Carr’s articles. There’s something more than a little odd about considering the use of a smartphone by way of reading an article on a smartphone. But in a very real sense, there’s almost no way I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have read Carr’s article otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And accordingly, the second irony is that, although Carr, who has staked out a position as a popular-level writer tackling issues of how modern information technology affects us, &lt;a href="https://t.alibris.com/The-Shallows-What-the-Internet-Is-Doing-to-Our-Brains-Nicholas-Carr/book/11882057" title="The Shallows"&gt;certainly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; published in hard copy&lt;/a&gt;, everything of his I’ve ever read has been in digital form. Indeed, although his books are important in their own ways, I think it’s fair to say that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people’s interaction with his ideas, including his critiques of the ways we use and indeed rely on the internet, have all happened via and only because of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure what to make of these observations. I don’t fault Carr for publishing a blog, exactly; and though I am increasingly chastened about my own at-times-unwise use of a smartphone, I don’t fault myself for having an RSS reader there. (Better than that a Twitter app, to be sure!) But there is something at a minimum &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps even something &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; about the ways that we tend to use the very tools we are critiquing as the medium for advancing our critiques. We implicate ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is the alternative? On the one hand Carr’s message—which is important!—has likely been heard and even internalized by a far broader audience because he has transmitted it digitally than it would have been had he conscientiously limited it to books (and perhaps print media articles). The efficacy of the medium for distribution is the internet’s greatest strength. Likewise, I would never have run into Carr’s writing in the first place apart from articles in my RSS feed which linked it; and I do a great deal of my RSS feed reading on my iPhone and iPad, both of which are much better &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; environments than a laptop or a desktop computer. Indeed, much of what I find most helpful in my reading on technology and ethics I find my way to via articles in my RSS feed, and I often items for reading later by simply tapping a an interesting-looking link in an article I’m reading in that RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we make of this tension, these ironies? Especially when our concerns begin to rise to the level not merely of prudential judgments (though that level alone is perhaps sufficient reason to do more than we let ourselves) but deep ethical worries—do we abandon the smartphone altogether, cease blogging for fear of how it only contributes to the Google-ified and Facebook-ified age we live in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my concerns in my &lt;a href="http://www.chriskrycho.com/2017/why-do-i-need-a-research-tool.html"&gt;ongoing project&lt;/a&gt; is to prompt people around me—friends and family, but perhaps also blog readers!—to consider how our use of technology &lt;em&gt;forms&lt;/em&gt; us. More on that in a future post.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in. (Uber &lt;abbr&gt;CEO&lt;/abbr&gt; Travis Kalanick’s statement quoted at &lt;a href="http://www.recode.net/2017/2/19/14665076/ubers-travis-kalanick-susan-fowler-sexual-harassment-investigation"&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day. (Amazon &lt;abbr&gt;CEO&lt;/abbr&gt; Jeff Bezos’ statement quoted at &lt;a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/"&gt;Geekwire&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this is simple. You can say all day that these events don’t represent your culture. But they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. And if you’re not aware of it, that means you have two problems: the culture problem, and the fact that you’re so out of touch with what your company is actually like that you don’t know it has that culture problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you have one other, even bigger problem. If that’s the culture of the company you’ve built, it’s &lt;em&gt;your fault&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t foist it off on your underlings: you hired them. You can’t foist it off on the bureaucracy: you built it. You can’t foist it off on wrong priorities: you set those priorities. It’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;
