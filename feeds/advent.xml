Have a little homily from me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, Jesus also shared in these, so that through His death He might destroy the one holding the power of death—that is, the Devil—and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death. (Heb. 2:14–15 HSCB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gregory Nazianzus reflected, centuries later: “…that which He has not assumed He has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved.” And the good news is that he united &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about our humanity to His Godhead: he heals and saves everything of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So happy day! We remember the first Advent of God the Son, and look with hope for the second, when there will be no more tears, no more sorrow, no more war, no more death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace and peace to you all. Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
