This week, since I’m taking some time off, I got to participate! The prompt was: &lt;em&gt;Write a story about trees which whisper poems to those who know how to hear them. (It’s not allowed to be scary.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first question was: “Who taught the trees to speak?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second, of course, was: “Any why only in such &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; poetry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t always know about the whispers, and of course I didn’t believe old Dallet when he told me about it, and it took me six weeks to hear them for the first time myself—so I didn’t particularly expect Annyth to hear them immediately after I mentioned them to her. I probably should have. She’d always been a little odd. But whatever the reason, she just blinked those round not-quite-brown, not-quite-green eyes at me a few times, like some slightly startled owl caught out in daylight, and then giggled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good reason: the spruces had just started in on a ridiculous ditty about nymphs—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;They dance like dancers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and twirl like twirlers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and all the little nymphs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;are sort of like curlers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;but sans the ice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and add a dash of spice…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; kinds of puns and rhymes, for hours on end. Annyth’s second question had good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I’d gotten lost in my own mind again, listening to the rhymes, because she repeated her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who taught the trees to speak? Any why only in such &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; poetry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. “No one knows who taught them. Maybe they’ve always known.” She somehow managed to furrow her brows &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; quirk them at me at the same time. “Okay, probably not, but Dallet said his grandfather taught him, and that &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; great-uncle taught him, and so on back a thousand years, and either the first one forgot to tell anyone that he was the one responsible for it all, or everyone else—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Heard this terrible poetry and decided to make sure his name didn’t live on at all?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. &amp;quot;Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nymph poem had ended; now they were onto something about stream beds…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It runs, so cool, down through the bed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And even though, the stream, it has no head&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It likes to lie down in its bed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Until it comes to make us fed…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned away from the trees for a moment and looked at me. “Is it… &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; this bad?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged again. “Not… &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now her eyebrows were &lt;em&gt;raised&lt;/em&gt; and quirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean, sometimes it’s actually worse. When they start telling limericks… just stop up your ears. But every once in a while some tree or another will start up a sonnet and you’ll get those fourteen lines of decency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smirked. “A sonnet? Tree love poems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged again. I seemed to be doing a lot of that today. “As far as tree love poems go, honestly, the sonnets are preferable. Sappy but not… weird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the eyebrows went completely flat. “I don’t think I want to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t, but you probably will, soon enough. Now that you’ve heard them, you’ll never be able to &lt;em&gt;unhear&lt;/em&gt; them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” The eyebrows were climbing again. “Don’t they stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled my &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; smile at her. “What, exactly, do you think you’re hearing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyebrows furrowed for a moment again as she listened, then twitched and quivered a moment in what looked like consternation, then rose until I thought they would come entirely off the top of her head. “No. No no no no no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. Again. &lt;em&gt;Stop shrugging, idiot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the &lt;em&gt;wind&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded, smiled my &lt;em&gt;sympathetic, just-one-side-of-my-mouth quirked&lt;/em&gt; smile at her. “And when was the last time you heard a day without a breeze?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth shook her head. Her eyebrows were darting furiously this way and that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such versatile eyebrows, truly. She started breathing a little faster. Her eyes were darting to match her eyebrows. “You mean to tell me that you thought it would be &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; to subject me to these awful, awful rhymes for the &lt;em&gt;rest of my life&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you said, you…” she paused, listened for a moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;like a jolly little man with no brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;he dances across the plain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and does a dance, a sprightly jig&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;as if he were a baboon grown over big&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You little man with no brain, you baboon grown over big!” The eyebrows were low and fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I… shrugged. &lt;em&gt;Again.&lt;/em&gt; What was it with the shrugs today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth paused. “They weren’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; singing that about you, were they?” Now the eyebrows were in thinking posture: left furrowed more than right, right slightly quirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried desperately to keep my shoulders from moving. No more shrugs. “I… honestly don’t know. I’ve never really paid attention to why the songs change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth stared at me like I were a complete dunce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He does not see, he has no eyes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Though stare out from his face they do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He listens to winds and hears but lies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Though every day he hears the truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; eyes went wide. &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; eyes went wide. We looked at the trees. I swallowed. “That was… just a coincidence, don’t you think?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered, looked at her. Her hazel owl eyes stared back wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it whispered in the spruce trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We breathed. “Ask what?” Annyth whispered back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ten thousand years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call and response: the oaks were answering the spruce trees with a low flutter to the whisper in the needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Just one question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ignored, unheard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Why do you have ears&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;And we speak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;And you listen not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at Annyth, ran my tongue across my bottom teeth, shrugged (of course), and mouthed, “Ask?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She giggled. The sound startled in the silence, but still the trees stood waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleared my throat. “Ask what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes at me. “Who taught you to speak?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, like a whispered shout in the gathering dusk, spruce and oak in chorus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled at me. “When?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;At dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;At beginning times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;At start of age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
       &lt;em&gt;At end of unseeing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyebrows wide, Annyth asked: “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annyth’s eyes were bright with joy, and round; her eyebrows high again. I shrugged uncomprehending. “Don’t you hear?” she said. “We just keep asking. That’s what we do. Until we find the truth. We keep asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask, ask, ask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poetry ran on. But no more folly. Now it had &lt;em&gt;answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We decided to do a little writing challenge! The rules of our challenge were: we had 30 minutes to write at least 500 words, it had to be fantasy, it had to be about someone the opposite sex of the author, and it had to be about someone elderly. This is mine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened, but it did not creak. It &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; creaked. Like Janice’s bones in the morning, it creaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She frowned at the back of the door facing her. Someone stood there, it seemed; a shadow darkened the floor by the doorway. Her eyes were rheumy enough, and the room layout ridicuous enough, that she couldn’t say more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who is it? she called out. Croaked out, more like, but that was the price of eighty years’ of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time.» Helpful response, that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?” She was still croaking. She coughed, tried to clear her throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time,» he said again. She thought it was a he, but his voice sounded funny. Far away. Then again, her ears had been going for long enough now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time? Kids aren’t coming today, so you can have all you want. But who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow looked darker. She frowned, pursed her lips, and shook her head. “Young man—you are young, aren’t you? You don’t sound old—come in here and sit down and explain yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«I. sit. for. no. one.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice blinked a few times. She sat back in her chair. She tried to take a deep breath, coughed, coughed some more, gave up on the deep breath, contented herself with a swallow instead. That seemed more appropriate anyway. But no, she was just being absurd. Old, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, all right, then, but come in where I can see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«No. it. is. your. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She swallowed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Time for what?” Just to be sure. The shadow was still getting darker. It could have been her eyes, but the rest of the room was the same as before: fuzzed out to an irritating degree, but bright enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Time. to. depart.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Son, or whatever you are” (she no longer thought it was anyone who ought to be called son, or daughter for that matter) “be clear. I don’t have time for whatever your game is. Had enough of foolishness twenty years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«It. is. time. for. you. to. depart. this. life.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then. One thing to have a half-cocked notion of a thing like that, but another hear it from the mouth of… time? itself. “Is it now?” she managed. “Well, you took long enough getting here. Family’s been telling me that for a good twenty years now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the shadow stood on the floor in front of the door was all dark now. Shaped something like a man, for all her blurred sight could make out, but black as a night when all the moons were down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was ready, though. Ready as you could be. “Do you announce yourself to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; like this, or just half-blind old ladies?” She sounded like a bullfrog with a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow answered. «All. those. who. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpful. Not that it mattered. She &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ready. She was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow was suddenly before her. A starless, moonless night. Time indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice stood up. Face it on your feet, she’d always said. To the blazes with that, now, she concluded. Face it asleep in the night was a better plan. But here she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She could still run. Jump a little even. So she did. She threw herself at the shadow, and as she came to it, she thought she saw stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then everything was gone except the stars, whirling before suddenly clear eyes. Ten billion galaxies whirled; pulsars flamed and danced in time; suns flared and planets spun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green grass, dusted with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«You. have. time.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked up. Stars, not night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Spend. it. well.»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stood.&lt;/p&gt;
