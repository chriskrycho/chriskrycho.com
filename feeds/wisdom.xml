&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I got a particularly thoughtful email from a friend about his family’s use of Facebook in response to &lt;a href="https://www.chriskrycho.com/2019/breaking-up-with-social-media.html"&gt;yesterday’s essay&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve reproduced most of my response here because I think it’s a helpful extension on that essay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (a) totally hear where you’re coming from, and deeply sympathize; and (b) deeply disagree about the notion that they’re “just tools – not good or evil in themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree in the strictest sense that the tools are not evil in and of themselves. But I think that particular framing is actually extremely misleading. Tools have &lt;em&gt;shapes&lt;/em&gt;, and those shapes form us in ways that may prove out to be particular bad. The usual example is: use a hammer for hours a day every day, and you’ll end up with calluses and quite possibly some hilariously out-of-proportion forearms if you don’t figure out how to be ambidextrous at least for hammering. That tools are not inherently moral does not mean they’re &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt;. (I also am not persuaded that tools are themselves always &lt;em&gt;morally&lt;/em&gt; neutral, but that’s another discussion and a subtler one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the social media tools, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think there are differences in both degree (the extent to which they shape us) and kind (the particular shapes they press us into as we use them). Thus my willingness to work for LinkedIn and my &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;willingness to work for Twitter or Facebook! And with that in mind, I do agree that the tradeoffs around Facebook can look very different than those around Twitter today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, I’d go so far as to say that a service much like Facebook but retooled in certain very important ways could be a much-less-alloyed good in the world! (There are no unalloyed goods in our fallen reality, of course.) A service that was less interested in &lt;em&gt;driving user attention&lt;/em&gt; and therefore constantly working in ways that actively undermine people’s self-control and ability to disengage could have most (probably all!) the upsides Facebook offers you and your family today, with few of the horrid downsides we’re seeing with it at the macro scale and few (if any) of the downsides I have felt with it personally at the micro scale. It’s those vicious little loops driving me to check obsessively that I want out of—not the ability to have geographically distributed people able to stay in touch and indeed even to connect, of the sort you and I have benefited from so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of that is an argument for everyone to get off of Facebook. I certainly think you and your family have very &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; reasons to be there. Rather, it’s more that the more of us who make the kinds of moves I’m making, the more it opens back up the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; that those communities could form in other spaces, and creates the &lt;em&gt;reminder&lt;/em&gt; for others that in fact many people are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in those spaces. It’s a very long play, for sure, but, you know: &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org"&gt;winning slowly&lt;/a&gt; and all that jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard it’s not so different from my rejection of Amazon: I’m under no misapprehension that I’m going to have any meaningful effect on the company itself, and in fact I have friends who I think are &lt;em&gt;very wise&lt;/em&gt; to continue using it because e.g. Prime eliminates needless frictions from their very challenging lives. It’s that my opting out allows me to support &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt;—healthier!—businesses and hopefully keep them going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is kind of a long way of saying: these are &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt; questions, and I think that wisdom not only allows but indeed &lt;em&gt;dictates&lt;/em&gt; different courses for different people.&lt;/p&gt;

M. Sacasas)</title><link>http://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/zuckerbergs-blindness-and-ours-l-m-sacasas.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while talking with my wife as we drove to spend some time with extended family, I caught myself: tempted to describe a given &lt;em&gt;response&lt;/em&gt; to a particular cultural ill as a &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt;. This is a turn of thinking that’s especially tempting for engineers—and perhaps the more so engineers with a physics background (like me!). In two of the fields to which I have applied myself (physics and software), knowledge often genuinely appears in the form of &lt;em&gt;solutions to problems&lt;/em&gt;. But the extent to which science (and scientism) on the one hand and engineering disciplines (especially software) on the other have come to the fore in our culture—the degree to which they have achieved nearly unassailable authority for us—means that we now too often take solutions as coextant with knowledge more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;solutionism&lt;/em&gt;, and it is bad. I noted above that two of the fields to which I have applied myself share this feature of having solutions to problems as their predominant form of knowledge. But this is not so in two of the other fields I have studied in some depth: for neither theology nor music is a &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt; very often in demand. Very different modes of thought and of reasoning are in play in each of those, and appropriately so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was with some particular appreciation that I read &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/09/16/zuckerbergs-blindness-and-ours/"&gt;this piece by L. M. Sacasas&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on the recent New Yorker profile of Mark Zuckerberg. Sacasas rightly highlights how mistaken this solutionist frame of knowledge is. From his conclusion (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing knowledge to know-how and doing away with thought leaves us trapped by an impulse to see the world merely as a field of problems to be solved by the application of the proper tool or technique, and this impulse is also compulsive because it cannot abide inaction. We can call this an ideology or we can simply call it a frame of mind, but either way it seems that this is closer to the truth about the mindset of Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter of stupidity or education, formally understood, or any kind of personal turpitude. Indeed, by most accounts, Zuckerberg is both earnest and, in his own way, thoughtful. Rather it is the case that one’s intelligence and one’s education, even if it were deeply humanistic, and one’s moral outlook, otherwise exemplary and decent, are framed by something more fundamental: a distinctive way of perceiving the world. This way of seeing the world, including the human being, as a field of problems to be solved by the application of tools and techniques, bends all of our faculties to its own ends. &lt;em&gt;The solution is the truth, the solution is the good, the solution the beautiful. Nothing that is given is valued.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trouble with this way of seeing the world is that it cannot quite imagine the possibility that some problems are not susceptible to merely technical solutions or, much less, that some problems are best abided.&lt;/em&gt; It is also plagued by hubris—often of the worst sort, the hubris of the powerful and well-intentioned—and, consequently, it is incapable of perceiving its own limits. As in the Greek tragedies, hubris generates blindness, a blindness born precisely out of one’s distinctive way of seeing. And that’s not the worst of it. That worst of it is that we are all, to some degree, now tempted and prone to see the world in just this way too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase itself says enough. It is the stereotypical and often self-caricaturing ethos of Silicon Valley: the rejection of what has come before, only to discover/invent/disrupt it as if it were wholly new, and proclaim the glories of tech startup culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did once have a word for the idea of being attentive to your own strengths and weaknesses, and disciplining yourself in response to this so you could accomplish the things that are truly important. We called it &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt;, and the pursuit of it was considered—in some circles, anyway—one of the great aims of human existence. All the great philosophical and religious traditions have had something to say about it. Many of them even find considerable concord on the sorts of practical wisdom for accomplishing goals that is an essential part of human flourishing, even as they disagree sharply about what constitutes that human flourishing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look to the tech startup scene and “wisdom” is not a word to be found in that vernacular. Instead we have “life hacks.” The anthropology here may be implicit, but it’s also obvious, and very dumb. We are not machines to be hacked. We are people, who ought to seek the good—wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
