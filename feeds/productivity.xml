But especially people interested in ideas of “productivity” or accomplishing the things we set out to do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have on my mind this week starting things, and finishing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a chest strap heart-rate monitor again a week ago, and took a run with it. It felt like starting (&lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, in this case!) with running. I am training for a couple of half marathons and a long couple days’ of road cycling in the Rocky Mountains in between them. As I wrote in a &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/serious-running-and-my-heart-rate-monitor.html"&gt;blog post earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, putting that chest strap on flipped the little switch in my brain that said “This is serious running again.” It helps to have registered for those races and committed to that event. I have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; done better at running when I have had a concrete goal in view. It has helped me with &lt;em&gt;finishing&lt;/em&gt;. Though I have had to skip out on a few races I have registered for by way of illness or (in one case) moving across the country, I have only failed to train up sufficiently for a race I had registered for &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; (and that, too, was a function of illness, though it wasn’t initially clear to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past four months I decided it was time to start working seriously on some things I have been thinking about for a long time now. One is developing an app (really: a family of them) that I have been nooding on for almost four years now. Another is learning how to build programming languages. Still another is writing some long-form essays, the subjects of which I have been mulling on in some way or another for as long as five years. My challenge in these kinds of projects is twofold: in many cases, the projects themselves are large enough as to seem daunting to me. In others, though I start them, I find the finishing difficult when I am already tired with the many other things on my plate. Having specific and concrete goals would, it seems to me, &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;—just as in running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, several times now, started open source software projects and never finished them. I have started a (genuinely interesting!) novel/novella/short story (the format is hard to nail down for this idea!) three or four times, and never seen it through. I have a handful of &lt;em&gt;very good&lt;/em&gt; essays sitting in my drafts folder that I began either for this site or for Mere Orthodoxy during my seminary years; some of them are 90% done and had I taken just another half an hour they would have been ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange though it might seem to people who see only what looks like very high productivity from me, I have a surprisingly hard time &lt;em&gt;finishing&lt;/em&gt; things. Starting them is easy. But sitting down, week in and week out, to get them across the line—it is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. The more amorphous the task, the less clear-cut “done” is, the harder I find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for the rest of my thirties is to get better at this: at picking specific projects and leaning into them until I finish them. Even if that means setting aside other good and important projects along the way. There are only so many hours in the day, and there are many few of them available for side projects when one aims to be a good husband and father. I am still getting a handle on this; more reports from the field as I hopefully improve at it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend was asking me the other day what my workflow looks like, and while I don’t generally spend a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time writing about my working setup, I figured I’d throw up a quick post representing my &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; list so that if people ask I can point them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two important notes on this, though: First, this is &lt;em&gt;just what I use&lt;/em&gt;. I make no particular claim that it’s &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt;. There are lots of things here that are very specific to me and the way I work, and even to my specific mental quirks. Second, it’s far more important to care about the work you do than about the tools you use to get it done. The tools matter: some people say they don’t and I don’t think that’s right at all. But they don’t matter as much as they might &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they do, and tool fetishism is real. I think the happy point is finding tools which are good enough and fit comfortably enough into your workflow that they don’t &lt;em&gt;distract&lt;/em&gt; you, and then get back to the work you do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;section id="software-development" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For software development, I currently use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; as my primary text editor; I also occasionally use Sublime Text or Vim for specific tasks where it makes sense. Code is incredibly fast, impressively low in memory usage given it’s an Electron app, and remarkably customizable. My only outstanding complaint is that there’s no way to actually make it look like a native macOS app. Happily, I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make it &lt;em&gt;behave&lt;/em&gt; like a native macOS app in all the ways that matter to me. Its support for both TypeScript and Rust—the two languages I spend the most time with right now—is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;. You’re welcome to see &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/chriskrycho/f39442dd78ad6d150bcaaadd9fedf9f4"&gt;my full configuration&lt;/a&gt;; I keep it updated at that location via the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync"&gt;Settings Sync&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS’ built-in Terminal app, just using its tabs for individual tasks. I have spent a lot of time with alternatives, including &lt;a href="https://iterm2.com"&gt;iTerm 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/"&gt;kitty&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m comfortable in &lt;a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki"&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt; – but at the end of the day I just like the way Terminal &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; the best. It’s fast, light, and built-in macOS things all just work correctly out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://git-fork.com"&gt;Fork&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; &lt;abbr&gt;GUI&lt;/abbr&gt;. I’ve also used &lt;a href="https://www.git-tower.com"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but I’ve found Fork to be lighter, faster, and a better fit for the way I think and how I expect things to behave (e.g. for interactive rebasing). I do a ton of work in git on the command line as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix, varying day by day, of Safari Tech Preview, Firefox, and Chrome for my test browsers. I substantially prefer Safari in nearly every way, but Chrome’s dev tools remain best in class for most things—with the exception of Grid, where Firefox is still the undisputed champion. (When I can, I do most of my JavaScript/TypeScript debugging in VS Code, though: it’s a much better experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kapeli.com/dash"&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; for offline documentation access. There are other options out there, including some which are free, but Dash remains the best in my experience, and if nothing else it’s deeply integrated into my workflow and muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s basically the whole list at the moment. I keep my software development workflow fairly light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="research-and-writing" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research and writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For research and writing, I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ia.net/writer"&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; for all my blogging and longer-form writing. This is a recent change; I had been a heavy user of &lt;a href="http://www.ulysses.app"&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; for the last few years. However, while Ulysses was the best option I had found for how I work, it’s never been quite &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; for me. For one, I’ve always found Ulysses’ “feel” to be a bit heavy: it’s &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; noticeably slower for me than most of the other writing apps, and I’m hypersensitive to input latency. I’ve also always disliked one of the things that makes many people love it: the way it abstracts Markdown into its “smart text objects.” iA Writer gives me the ability to manage a library in much the same way that Ulysses did, but in a way that feels more truly native on both macOS and iOS; it just uses normal Markdown (no fancy text objects); and it’s &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That combo makes it a better fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bear.app"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; for my note-taking. I’ve talked about this &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/starting-to-build-a-zettelkasten.html"&gt;a fair bit&lt;/a&gt; here &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/zettelkasten-update-all-in-on-bear.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t belabor the details. It’s an excellent, lightweight note-taking app. The main way it falls down for me is that it does not really handle nested block content in Markdown documents (e.g. it won’t correctly display a block quote inside another block quote, or a code sample inside a list, etc.). I’d also love it if it stored its library in a way that made it easier for me to interact with from other apps, i.e. as plain text on the local drive. (You can export content from it easily enough, which is great, but it’s not quite as seamless as I’d like.) Those nits are just that, though: nits. I’m very happy with Bear for my note-taking at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/"&gt;Unread&lt;/a&gt; on iOS for reading RSS, with &lt;a href="https://feedbin.com"&gt;Feedbin&lt;/a&gt; as my long-preferred RSS feed service backing it. (I’m a fan of paying for these kinds of services, so I’m happy to lay out the $5/month for Feedbin. Free alternatives exist, but I don’t love ad-driven models and avoid them where I can.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll note that there are no apps for reading &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; material on that list. I could mention Apple Books as the place I read most ebooks I read, but that’s more a function of the alternatives not being meaningfully &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in the ways I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="productivity" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Productivity”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For “productivity” concerns, I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tadamapp.com"&gt;Tadam&lt;/a&gt; for a Pomodoro timer—because it’s precisely as annoyingly obtrusive as I need it to be, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;!—and &lt;a href="https://bear.app"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/just-write-down-what-you-do.html"&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; what I do each Pomodoro cycle, each day, each week, each month, and each year. That habit remains very helpful for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt; for a to-do app. Things hits the sweet spot for me in terms of its ability to manage everything from simple tasks and recurring to-do items around the house up to complex multi-month-long projects. I particularly like its distinction between when I want to be &lt;em&gt;reminded&lt;/em&gt; about something and when that task is &lt;em&gt;due&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve used &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but it never quite &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt; me; Things does. They’re very comparable in terms of features; it’s just that the way Things approaches those features works better for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sparkmailapp.com"&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt; as my email client, mostly for its snooze feature, which I use when I know I need to see an email &lt;em&gt;as an email&lt;/em&gt; sometime later, and its ability to integrate nicely with other apps. I have it connect to Things, and emails that require an &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; get put there instead of snoozed. The combination lets me keep my inbox at Zero by the end of every day. And its lovely “Inbox Zero” images are a really nice touch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/chriskrycho-com/images/inbox-zero-spark.png" alt="Inbox Zero in Spark" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Inbox Zero in Spark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="podcasting" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For podcast production, I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html"&gt;iZotope RX&lt;/a&gt; (I’m using v6 Standard) for audio cleanup, as I &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/izotope-rx-is-amazing.html"&gt;recently wrote about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/"&gt;Logic Pro X&lt;/a&gt; for the actual editing work most of the time, occasionally using &lt;a href="https://www.wooji-juice.com/products/ferrite/"&gt;Ferrite&lt;/a&gt;. Logic is overkill for what I do, but I’m &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; with it at this point, so I can’t see moving anytime soon, and there’s nothing else out there that I think is substantially &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; (though there are other apps that are comparably good).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.overcast.fm/forecast"&gt;Forecast&lt;/a&gt; for encoding and including chapter breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt; for generating the &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt; feeds, since all my podcasts are currently built in ways that don’t support &lt;abbr&gt;RSS&lt;/abbr&gt; feed generation: &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://massaffection.com"&gt;Mass Affection&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc"&gt;rustdoc&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt;. (If I ever manage to finish building my own site generator, it’ll have out-of-the-box support for custom RSS feed templates, so that I can have this stuff generated automatically for me!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; for serving the actual static site content (i.e. HTML, CSS, and JS), and &lt;a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2"&gt;Backblaze B2&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the audio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://panic.com/transmit/"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; for actually uploading the audio files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;iA Writer seems to get &lt;em&gt;randomly&lt;/em&gt; slow at times for reasons I haven’t yet identified, but at least for now, I’m taking that tradeoff over Ulysses’ habit of being a bit slow &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. As I’ve often noted before: &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html" title="Ulysses, Byword, and “Just Right”"&gt;my ideal writing app doesn’t exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass Affection isn’t dead! I promise!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve slowly but surely been coming out of this burnout over the last seven weeks or so. I pulled &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; on some levers at work and got some changes there, which gave me the space to start recovering. I have also been working aggressively at identifying what steps I need to take to deal with my mental health more generally—including dealing with a bunch of griefs that have mounted up over many, many years, and which I have (for various reasons, many of them good) simply set aside to deal with later. Do that too long, and later becomes &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, whether you want it to or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that this recovery phase has its own dangers, subtler but no less real than being in the thick of the burnout was. Now, I’m tempted to dive back into the deep end—to forget just how rough a spot I was in not that many weeks ago, and pick up too much, and… land myself back in that mess. As one of my pastors put it to me last week (putting to words things I’d been thinking), it’s easy to forget that just because we’re through the burnout doesn’t mean we have any reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: he was right. I don’t have any reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt, this week, a bit of a slide toward the same malaise and cynicism and deep fatigue that characterized me for a good long chunk of the year—and it’s no surprise why. We’ve been going nonstop since before Thanksgiving. I drove away from my house for a quick personal trip only twelve hours after we got back from visiting Jaimie’s family in Texas over that holiday. I gave one of the best (and probably one of the most important) tech talks I’ve ever given at Olo the day after I got back from that trip. I helped finish getting &lt;a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/29/a-new-look-for-rust-lang-org.html"&gt;the Rust website redesign&lt;/a&gt; out the door in time for the &lt;a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html"&gt;Rust 2018 Edition launch&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is very obvious to me that this has been &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;. I need to steward my recovery carefully, so that it proves to be a genuine recovery and not merely a little upswing before dipping back into burnout. I need to go ahead and deal with those unprocessed griefs. I need to say no to more things outside my family and work, no matter how good or appealing those things are. In the medium term, I need to build better patterns of life around all these things, so that I don’t end up again where I was in early October.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 18:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:v4.chriskrycho.com,2018-12-09:/2018/stewarding-my-reserves.html</guid><category>burnout</category><category>productivity</category><category>rest</category></item><item><title>Just Write Down What You Do</title><link>http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/just-write-down-what-you-do.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=editorial&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumed audience:&lt;/b&gt; people already persuaded of the value—at least to some extent—of “getting things done” strategies and having an idea of what you accomplished over the course of the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I’ve had a habit—not kept perfectly, but done more often than not, courtesy of my daily &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/pomodoro/"&gt;pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; discipline—of writing down what I do each day. Then, every week, I take a look at what I did each day, and turn that into a summary for the week. And every month, I look over my notes for weeks that made up that month, and write down what I did that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; for me professionally. For one thing, it gives me a quick and easy way to see what I’ve done over the past however-long-between-performance-evaluations. The inevitable “What did you accomplish this year?” question has an an easy answer: I can look over my month-level summaries and summarize &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt;. (I’m inevitably frustrated by the months where I slacked off and don’t actually know what I did when do this exercise!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing things down like this is also a helpful tool personally. I can look back at long stretches where I feel like I didn’t get a lot done and realize just many things I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; actually do. I have found this a helpful way of staving off the malaise that inevitably comes from months where there are just too many meetings, for example. What did I do? I &lt;i&gt;effected these changes&lt;/i&gt; (even if they weren’t in the form of code!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="https://bear.app"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; for this, but you could do it anywhere: a Word document or Google Doc, a notepad on your desk, in Emacs’ &lt;a href="https://orgmode.org"&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.taskpaper.com"&gt;TaskPaper&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href="#"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; (like my friend and colleague Ben Collins &lt;a href="https://benjamincollins.com/blog/using-trello-to-organize-my-daily-work/"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;), or, well… whatever gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing is: write down what you did! Write it down at each of these scales, because it’s far easier to write down the larger scales if you wrote down the smaller scales. Once you start doing this regularly, you’ll probably find yourself frustrated at the times you failed to do it. (If you’re like me, those times will exist. It’s okay. Just start back up.) And again: make it fit you. But it’s one of the best tools I know of for personal and professional development, so I commend it to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: My Bear Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re curious or want to copy my approach, here are the templates I use in Bear for each of my logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="daily-log" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Daily Log&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daily log is the core of my entire productivity approach system, as well as the foundation of this specific logging strategy. These entries each includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The date, which I format &lt;code&gt;YYYY.MM.DD&lt;/code&gt;—today would be &lt;code&gt;2018.11.13&lt;/code&gt;. A numeric year/month/day makes correctly sorting the notes easy. I use a period for the separator mostly because it looks nice in the font I use in Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A link to the parent week for the day, to make it easy to jump back and forth between individual day logs and a weekly log (as you’ll see below).&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A set of goals. I set the goals either at the beginning of the day, at the end of the preceding work day, or a combination of the two. I usually limit myself to 3 goals, unless I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I have a bunch of very small tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of pomodoro sessions. The pomodoro technique is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; effective for getting things done—both in my experience and as others describe it—when each block has both a discrete goal and what you actually got done. This helps me keep my focus during that session rather than getting sidetracked. I further break these down with &lt;strong&gt;Session 1&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Break&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Session 2&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. subheads—not because this makes me productive, but just because I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A summary of the day as a whole. At the end of the day, I look back over the sessions and my goals, and write a sentence or two about what I did. This is also often a good time for me to write up the next day’s overarching goals and first session goal: I have a much better idea what I should be doing next when I’m wrapping things up for the day than I will the next morning!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A set of checkboxes for me to track whether I succeed in breaking my day into 15 discrete pomodoro sessions,&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in standing at least 5 hours out of the day every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;section id="weekly-log" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Weekly log&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekly log is just a place for me to be able to easily capture the results of my daily efforts. It links to the monthly log at the top just like the daily logs link to the month: for easy jumping back and forth. Each of the bullet points under &lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt; gets linked to a daily log entry, and the &lt;code&gt;::TODO::&lt;/code&gt; items get replaced with the &lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; from the daily log. At the end of the week, I write a summary of the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt; heading here is new, something I only just started doing in the last couple of weeks, but so far it has proven helpful for me as I orient myself to what I want to get done on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# &amp;lt;YYYY.MM.DD&amp;gt; – &amp;lt;YYYY.MM.DD&amp;gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Monthly log&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly log is exactly like the weekly log, but one level higher. It links back to individual weeks for easy jumping back and forth between the two views, and it newly has month-level goals. (As with weeks, I’m still experimenting with those!) The &lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt; bullets get filled in with links to weeks and the summary of each week copied over. At the end of the month, I take a few minutes to summarize those weeks. Unlike the lower-level summaries, I let that month-level summary expand out to a paragraph if need be. A lot tends to happen in a month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[&amp;lt;some text&amp;gt;]]&lt;/code&gt; is Bear’s way of doing internal links to a note named &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;some text&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;15, not 16, because of the slop that ends up in most days. Most days, more than one session ends up being 35 minutes instead of 25. Over the course of the day, those come out to being the remaining half hour in the full 8 hours I make sure I give my employer. I know that from measuring consistently when I was working as a consultant: my &lt;a href="https://toggl.com"&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt; logs told the story clearly.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Writing (currently mostly expressed in the form of blogging) is deep in me, and so blogging remains a helpful outlet.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But so a fair number of other things which might look like &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I started putting together some thoughts on what some extensions to an open source software library I maintain might look like.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This after what has to be a record-setting week: the kind in which I reviewed and merged 60 pull requests for a ridiculous crunch of a project I’m on at work. I’m exhausted. I had another one of those moments this evening where I started crying a bit as I was sitting down to eat dinner and praying beforehand. Why? Just because I’m &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; emotionally wrung out: nothing was wrong in the particular moment at all, and probably the “trigger” was actually the small bit of relief of being &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the particular (very weird) stressors of this project at work for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why in the world did I start writing up thoughts about an open-source library after that? And why have I been spending my evenings reading all about a particularly nerdy bit of computer science this week?&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Because, as I suggested at the beginning, these things are what end up feeling restful or re-energizing to me. (That might make me weird. I’m okay with that. I’ve been weird for a long time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the advice around burnout emphasizes “not working.” There’s good reason for that, but it’s important to understand the underlying reasons for that advice. Burnout &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; stems from work-related stress, for an appropriately broad definition of “work.”&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Besides the stressors themselves, many of us—whether we admit it or not!—put far too much of our self-worth into our work. Putting it aside leaves us feeling worthless or useless. If your burnout is coming from the combo of stress and having invested your self-worth in your work, then you’re not likely to get better until you disengage from that work &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; for large stretches of time: that is, until you are &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to divest your self-worth from your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other ways burnout comes to pass. For me, it’s a combination of particular work stressors with the stress my family has undergone over the last year: a cross-country move, building a house, and most of all my father’s (so far blessedly successful) fight with a brain tumor. The work stressors are largely not related to the work &lt;em&gt;load&lt;/em&gt;, though; and I have by God’s grace kept my personal sense of meaning and value detached from my job. Insofar as my work is involved, the burnout is much more about frustrations and stymied aims and boredom with certain parts of the job than it is about overwork! The net of that is that doing some open-source brainstorming in the evenings is not a way of reinforcing the things that have caused this (though it very well &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; become that). Rather, left in the same kinds of space as my blogging (“not on a schedule, not on a deadline, but whenever I feel like it”), it ends up being a &lt;em&gt;counter&lt;/em&gt; to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is a long way of saying: if you’re experiencing burnout, you need to figure out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; if you want to have a chance of getting through it. Otherwise good advice will actually mislead you otherwise. If your problem is that you’ve dumped all your self-worth into your open-source work, &lt;em&gt;stop doing open-source work&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, if the cause of your burnout is that you’re deeply invested in caretaking for someone in your family, it might well be that doing something that looks like &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; to someone else—even writing a novel or something similarly massive in scale—might be a genuine relief and outlet for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;em&gt;genuine rest&lt;/em&gt; often includes writing and learning and thinking and creating—not by themselves, but as part of a healthy mix that includes many other good things: a healthy dose of exercise and building LEGO contraptions with my daughters and watching &lt;cite&gt;The Expanse&lt;/cite&gt; with my wife, and enjoying the company of good friends over good food and good drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve actually been blogging longer than I’ve been writing software in any meaningful way. I did tiny bits of Visual Basic and C++ in middle school and high school, and I started picking up &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr&gt;CSS&lt;/abbr&gt; for the sake of my website and blog in college. I didn’t pick up programming in a more general sense until I learned Fortran for my senior capstone project in physics!&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking about &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; extensions to &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt;, for those of you interested in the details. I’ll have a GitHub issue up sometime soon-ish, and might blog about it here as well.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type"&gt;&lt;abbr title="Conflict-free Replicated Data Type"&gt;CRDT&lt;/abbr&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;, for my fellow software nerds out there. &lt;a href="http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/" title="Data Laced With History"&gt;This introduction&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely outstanding, as are a number of the pieces it links to. Among other things, I actually &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; a few concepts in set theory I’ve had a hard time wrapping my head around in the past, because the explanations here are so good.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I talked about in my &lt;a href="https://newrustacean.com/show_notes/bonus/burnout/"&gt;New Rustacean episode about burnout&lt;/a&gt;, lots of things which &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; “work” in the “what I do to pay the bills” sense can also be triggers.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It was, in a word, &lt;em&gt;bliss&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve come to enjoy a lot of chatting during the day while at work, and the social interaction is very much a &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; in a lot of ways for someone who works remotely. The flip side, however, is that chat is a huge time-suck, and more than that it’s a constant drain on attention. I’m far from the first person to see this or to say it, of course, and I’ve experienced it before. But it struck me much more forcefully this week than it usually has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of that, I suspect, is the effect of the burnout I’ve been experiencing: I’m much more taxed by social interaction and by shifts in attention right now than I have been in the past. More and more, though, I’ve also become aware of the effect the constant distraction of chat has on me. I am much less effective as a software developer when I am constantly switching modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure: some tasks are more mentally demanding than others. Some days I get done &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; while still switching contexts often—less, perhaps, than I might if I were not being interrupted, but also perhaps &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that enabling others to finish &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; tasks is also important. When I need to dive deep on something hard, though—or even when I just need to get after a &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; task—the kind of mental silence that signing out of chat affords is very helpful. I plan to make this a regular habit.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn’t fun. I concluded something attentive folks around me have likely known for a bit: I am dealing with low-level &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642" title="The Mayo Clinic’s summary of burnout"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you become cynical or critical at work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started once you arrive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you become irritable or impatient with co-workers, customers or clients?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you lack the energy to be consistently productive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you lack satisfaction from your achievements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you feel disillusioned about your job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to simply not feel?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your sleep habits or appetite changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you troubled by unexplained headaches, backaches or other physical complaints?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic (the source for that list) notes that if you’re suffering from any &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those, you may be experiencing burnout. By my count, I am experiencing &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re looking at the list and wondering: the first six. No changes to sleep, no abuse of food or drugs or alcohol, and I haven’t started having physical problems yet, which is why I classify what I’m experiencing as low-level or mild. But burnout is tricky. I’ve know a number of people who’ve had more serious cases—cases which led into significant physical problems that took them years to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, when people think about burnout, they tend to think of the kind that comes from &lt;em&gt;overwork&lt;/em&gt; or from a lack of rest. You certainly can (indeed: certainly will) burn out by pulling 80-hour weeks for years on end. But those are not the only way you can burn out. You can also do it by ending up in a spot where you have too much responsibility, or deep and lasting conflict within your working environment, or sharp ethical disagreements with your leadership, or even just—“just” being the wrong word here—lasting mismatches between your tasks and the things you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular reasons for my mild case of burnout aren’t the stereotypical kind. I get plenty of sleep, I enjoy my hobbies, I exercise and eat well, and I very carefully maintain a limit on the hours I work every week. I’m not &lt;em&gt;overworked&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a mix of other factors I won’t go into. The details aren’t actually that important here, and in any case my (genuinely excellent) manager knows them well and we are working on them together.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is important is trying to figure out how to keep the burnout from getting worse. And acknowledging that it can happen to anyone. And that you may not see it coming, may deny you’re experiencing till something finally makes it click for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this all finally click for me? It was &lt;a href="http://www.alliancenet.org/mos/postcards-from-palookaville/six-years-on#.W0vQM4pMFvI" title="Six Years On"&gt;this post by Carl Trueman&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on his own &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different vocation—specifically, his bivocational work as both a pastor and a professor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months into my pastorate, an academic friend who had done the same thing for nine years wrote me a letter and urged me to be careful – as soon as I ceased to enjoy the hobbies and casual pleasures of life, he warned, I would be close to burn-out and would need to step down. I was glad of the warning – every minister I have ever know who has burned out has told me that there was no obvious warning: one day everything seemed fine, the next they were barely able to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That started me thinking on my own experience, and if I’m not quite there, I can see warning signs. The biggest danger sign, for me, is an utter lack of motivation around some of my hobbies. I generally relax, as my wife can attest, in &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; ways—by writing, by building an open-source library, by reading hard-and-interesting books. For the last several months, I have had almost no interest in doing any of that. So I’ve a mild case at the moment, and I’m doing everything I can to keep it from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout like I have right now is not the end of the world, to be clear. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; manageable. Many people—including people in my own family—carry much more significant burdens in terms of physical and mental health. But it is real, and it’s dangerous in no small part because it can cascade into really serious mental and physical health problems if you let it spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I’m a bit slower on open-source projects for a while, you know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to be that blog post for someone else. If you’re experiencing the things on that list, figure out how to change &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can assume that it’s not sharp conflict over ethical issues, because nothing in the world would make me jet from a job faster than that would&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I am content to admit that I certainly haven’t done it every single day along the way–but I’m content with that admission in no small part because I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; done it &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; days along the way. And it has been genuinely wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things I have written along the way have come in many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve published around 50,000 words on this site already this year (even if ‘word count’ here is a loose metric: it includes lots of code samples and in some cases those code samples are repeated for effect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve put together a workshop and a couple of short talks on &lt;a href="https://www.emberjs.com"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve written a talk on the future of our front-end development practices at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve written and published 11 episodes of New Rustacean (totaling about 25,000 more words!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And very little of that could have or would have happened without the time I’ve dedicated nearly every weekday morning to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not so much that I’m hyper-productive on any one day. To the contrary: many days along the way I struggled just to get out a few hundred words of one of the projects I was working on, and those projects (however much I love them) have sometimes ended up being something of a slog. It’s okay: that’s the point of building the habit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the analogy before–as have many others, I’m sure!–of writing to running. There are many days when going for a run doesn’t actually seem all that appealing, but I go anyway, because I’ve long since developed the habit of just getting out whether I feel like it or not. Some of those days I very much do not enjoy the actual run, either: I find myself somewhere out along the way and end up feeling sick or simply having to work much harder than I could wish. But even if it’s a short and unpleasant run in the end, I come away having gone for a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing (or any other valuable habit) seems to be much the same. There are days I do not feel like doing it. There are days when the doing of it is hard, when I feel like I have to drag the words out of myself. There have been days even just in the last few weeks where I realized that words I’d written on previous days simply had to be thrown away–content for New Rustacean that ranged from ill-worded to actually-wrong, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have been able to say, nearly every workday when I wasn’t sick or traveling, that I did in fact write &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. And that’s enough, in truth. As I noted &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html" title="Momentum--Two weeks of daily writing, and how &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; happens."&gt;when I began building this habit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The] early morning is the best time for me to be writing, and I get a lot of mileage out of taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recognized six months ago, even when an individual day here or there slips, doing the work to make writing habitual means that the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; days don’t. The result is that, delightfully, I’ve been able to get a lot of writing done, even through times when I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn’t feel like writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next up: do the same thing with reading nonfiction books. I’ve read an absurd amount of fiction in the last year–and I allowed myself that intentionally as a kind of letdown after finishing seminary. But as I’ve noted in this space before, I don’t want to stay in that letdown mode forever. I want to build once again the habit of reading hard books carefully. The way to do it, of course, is… just to do it. Day by day, just &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully in six months I’ll have a report complementary to this one, where I can say that I &lt;em&gt;kept writing&lt;/em&gt; but also &lt;em&gt;started reading hard things again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a couple of these on my plate right now, but I also want to &lt;a href="http://esv.to/col3.23" title="Colossians 3:23"&gt;do my work well&lt;/a&gt;. Here I’m jotting down a couple of the strategies I’ve been taking so far; I’ll probably have another post like this in roughly six months when these particular projects are wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="section" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 1. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find related problems you can solve that support the effort or the team, which &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; intrinsically interesting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you keep your eyes open, you can sometimes find problems which don’t &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; advance the project you’re working on, but which both &lt;em&gt;indirectly&lt;/em&gt; advance the project and also give you something to work on when you need a break. In my context, this looks like small but broadly-useful pieces of developer tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: we’re in a spot where we’re spinning up a number of new applications in a given framework and stack. After getting through everything else on my plate this last Friday, I took a couple hours and started putting together a little tool that will make the major part of that process a single command-line invocation. This doesn’t directly advance the project I’m working on. But it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be useful for our whole team over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example here for me is identifying technical initiatives we need, and taking the time to think through how we can accomplish them. These are real problems that we really need to solve, and even if we don’t need them solved &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; (because we’re prioritizing other things), there is a lot of value in figuring out we’ll solve them when we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get to them in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those kinds of things can help by giving a sense of accomplishment while simultaneously doing something &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; the main task, but they don’t require huge blocks of time or keep you from getting the main project done. And they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; advance your team or your project in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-1" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 2. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find tasks which are &lt;em&gt;totally unrelated&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;instrincically interesting&lt;/em&gt;, but which do not keep you from getting your main job done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of like the previous task except that it may or may not even be related to what you’re working on. I have a couple pieces of technology work that I variously have started and will be starting that are totally unrelated to my main projects. But they’re things that I can go after a bit here and a bit there – the last half hour of a day when my brain is shot, or over lunch, or for a few hours when I’ve finished everything else on my plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of things help me by serving as a &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; for getting through the stuff I need to get through. They thus provide a kind of extrinsic motivation where my intrinsic motivation has flagged. They also have enough intrinsic interest of their own that I can feel some of that very helpful sense of accomplishing something I care about when I make progress on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that these things fit the profile I described, though: easy to move forward in small chunks of time, and okay to take a long while to finish. The danger with these–even more than with the first kind of small tasks I suggested–is that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; so interesting, and you have to make sure you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still get your regular work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-2" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 3. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find ways to gain a sense of &lt;em&gt;momentum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is in some ways the hardest of these, because it’s just digging in deeper on the slog of the project in question–but it’s also the one that most directly gets you closer to the end of the project. The trick is to find a rhythm where you actually move meaningfully closer to the goal of &lt;em&gt;finishing the project&lt;/em&gt; all the time, while not ending up bogged down in nothing but slogs along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of this is figuring out how to break up the project into smaller and more tractable pieces, and then alternating the various elements of it in such a way that you can continually feel the satisfaction of finishing things. Over the last two weeks at work, despite some pretty significant frustrations which made it really hard to do this, I came out with more of a sense of momentum than I had even before those frustrations came up–precisely because I actually knocked out the things we aimed to get done in that specific span of time. And we’re in a spot where we’re actually about to go live with the first meaningful chunk of what we’ve been building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping that sense of momentum is really important. Even when you’re looking at a 6-month stretch of not-that-interesting a set of work ahead of you, it helps to see yourself chipping away at it and making real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="section-3" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;– 4. –&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just watch &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sl9pTDK8PAk"&gt;this sequence from Doctor Who Series 9&lt;/a&gt; over and over again.&lt;/strong&gt; Or better yet, the whole episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that’s a hell of a bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

(I’ve been steadily pushing forward on &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-typings/issues/14"&gt;a big “quest”-style issue for an open source software project I help maintain&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s how I planned to spend my writing time today.) But I’m feeling quite keenly the need of some time away from that project and indeed from a lot of the things that have had me burning the candle at both ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve noted before that I &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/intentional-cyclicality.html"&gt;go in cycles&lt;/a&gt;; one thing that I’ve also started to notice is that those cycles, unsurprisingly, include points where I’m just &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. I’m all out of steam. And I seem to have hit one of those just this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense: since last October, as a family we’ve moved across the country; lived with my parents for three months, during which time we learned that my dad had brain cancer and helped him and my mom through the surgery, recovery, and early parts of chemo and radiation); then moved into a new house; and joined a new church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that I’ve personally continued working on &lt;a href="https://newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, helped ship the most important release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript"&gt;ember-cli-typescript&lt;/a&gt; in the project’s history, taught a workshop on TypeScript at EmberConf, and helped kick off one of the most important front-end development projects in Olo’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I’m tired. Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I feel like I’m just out of steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick, for the moment, is that there are some things I really feel I should carry to some specific points &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I take a week or two off. Getting that quest issue that I was going to be writing this morning done, and a related &lt;a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs"&gt;Ember.js RFC&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship of TypeScript and Ember.js, and getting the first of our beta releases for this project at Olo out the door… all of those are things that really just &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to happen before I take that time off. After I get through those, though, I think I’m taking a week or so off. Maybe time it with Memorial Day to make it a full 10 days or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the meantime, I do things like write little blog posts thinking about “running out of steam” not because it’s all that important for the world to know, but because it’s a way of keeping &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; degree of forward momentum, continuing to maintain my &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html"&gt;daily writing habit&lt;/a&gt;, and generally doing all the little things that make it possible for me to actually get across the finish line on those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because—weird though it may seem in some ways—even when I’m tired like it, I know through long experience that the way I actually get across those finish lines is by keeping up my forward motion. It’s very much like the feeling in the last 5k of a half marathon. (A half marathon is two five-milers and a 5k, and thinking about it that way is the way to run it effectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything hurts. You don’t feel like you have anything left. But in fact, if you’ve done the right things up to that point, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have enough left. The way to finish well is not only to keep putting one foot in front of the other, but also to push a little harder, and a little harder, and a little harder, until you hit the finish line. You have to watch out, of course, and not hurt yourself. That’s the trick with mental fatigue, too. Burnout is a real thing. But, as with running, if you’ve built up your mental muscles well and built up the reserves of &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; that you need, you know the difference. You know when you need to stop early for a day and go read a novel. You know when to push through. You know when to take a day off of the quest issue and write a quirky, and not-all-that-coherent, blog post about the experience of fatigue and thinking about pushing on. And you know that you still need to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (October 11, 2018):&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve added my &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/burnout/"&gt;#burnout&lt;/a&gt; tag to this post retroactively because I now recognize much of what I wrote here as some of the earlier symptoms of what I didn’t concretely identify until &lt;a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/some-mild-burnout.html"&gt;a bit later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We emphasize it at the expense of nearly everything else. That goes for the most individual evaluations to the structures and decisions of megacorporations. Our goal is to extract every last bit of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; from ourselves we can. And this is, in a word, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. It is bad not because work is bad, but because it is a good thing become the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing. (This is the usual way humans mess things up: we take good things and make them ultimate, when nothing we make or do can bear that weight.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given all of that, why do I &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/productivity/" title="Posts tagged “Productivity”"&gt;think and write so much about productivity&lt;/a&gt;? Put plainly, because I think the goods of creation and production are still worth pursuing, and I want to steward my time well accordingly. I want to create the things I am passionate about—from blog posts like this to &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com" title="New Rustacean"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org" title="Winning Slowly"&gt;episodes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://olo.com" title="Olo – online ordering for restaurants"&gt;the web apps I build&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript" title="Ember CLI TypeScript"&gt;the supporting tools&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth" title="True Myth"&gt;I work on&lt;/a&gt;—without that overwhelming the other things in my day. I think about productivity the way I do, in other words, because I want to be productive without productivity becoming an idol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put more directly: my efforts on the many projects I care about &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; come at the expense of loving my family well, serving my church, spending meaningful amounts and kinds of time with friends, and so on. There are many goods in this life we are responsible to pursue. That’s not the usual way we think about good things in life either: we tend to think about good things as things we &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to pursue, if we have time after our other less-good responsibilities. But I think that’s a misshapen view of the kinds of things I’m talking about here. Worship, family life, work, creative expression, service, teaching: these are all goods we are &lt;em&gt;called to&lt;/em&gt; (to various degrees, given the qualifiers of gifting and circumstances).&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore ought to think of them in terms of faithfulness. Do we do each of them to the best of our abilities, making good use of our time and abilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that consideration plays itself out in a variety of ways. One making sure that when I am working, I am working &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.esv.org/Colossians+3+23/" title="Colossians 3:23"&gt;doing my work well, honoring God in the doing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/log-all-the-things.html" title="Log All the Things!"&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; is a tool to that end. It, being a tool, can also be put to other, worse ends, of course: it could very well become a means to obsession with work! But my goal with it is simply to steward my time and attention well, in part so that I may have attention to pay—for attention is indeed &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/04/79-theses-on-technology-the-spectrum-of-attention/" title="79 Theses on Technology: The Spectrum of Attention"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/03/79-theses-on-technology-on-attention/" title="79 Theses on Technology: On Attention"&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://iasc-culture.org/THR/channels/Infernal_Machine/2015/04/79-theses-on-technology-jacobs-responds-to-wellmon/" title="79 Theses on Technology: Jacobs Responds to Wellmon"&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt;—in other, &lt;a href="https://thefrailestthing.com/2011/03/22/dont-worry-be-idle/" title="Don’t Worry, Be Idle"&gt;less “productive”&lt;/a&gt; but no less deeply important ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, setting aside this hour for writing every morning enables me to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; more and better in the ways I need to for the sake of faithful stewardship of my own God-given gifts and desires, and (no less importantly) for the sake of using those gifts and desires for the good of my community.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If I am unable to so much as muster a coherent thought because I’ve waited to do my writing until a time of day when I simply cannot think in that manner, then I am unable to use this combination of desire and ability for the glory of God and the good of my neighbors. But if I, aware of &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms"&gt;my bodily and intellectual rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, allocate an hour in the morning to write and an hour of lower concentration for e.g. taking a run in the silence of the empty winter fields near here, then I am able to both be productive when I ought to, and idle when I ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity,” then, as I conceive it &lt;em&gt;whenever&lt;/em&gt; I write about it here, is not an ultimate end. Having (and making good use of!) a to-do list, for example, is not about maximizing the number of things I can do in a given week. It is about carrying out my many vocations well, and not failing to do the things I ought. Your set of vocations looks different from mine. The set of things you ought not fail to do is different accordingly. And the tools you employ may be different: for reasons of phase of life, temperament, abilities, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity” as such is not the point. The point is faithfully doing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; things, and doing them for love of God and love of neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cf. Augustine, _Confessions_, Book 1, paragraph 1.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of this list is important, though it is perhaps also misleading: worship undergirds and shapes the others.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That passage was addressed to people in legal slavery (albeit a slavery very different in kind from the chattel slavery of the American South). I’m not here going to dig more deeply into the hermeneutics of applying it to someone doing labor in a market economy; suffice it to say I think that if a first century slave should work hard so as to honor God in his or her work, so ought we.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our desires and aims are not for ourselves. They’re meant to be gifts to those around us; used rightly, they can be.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested 2018 resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚡️ Tweet less. Blog more. ⚡️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll make all of our discourse better and richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m going to trace out how I plan to do that, in hopes that it’ll help others write (and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/947694285004201984"&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt;!) more blog posts—short posts, long posts, and everything in between. In another post (probably tomorrow or Thursday), I’ll explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I think this is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweet less.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re tempted to string together more than two or &lt;em&gt;at most&lt;/em&gt; three tweets… you have a blog post. Seriously! At 280 characters, if you assume a word is roughly 5 characters on average, and toss in spaces and punctuation, you’ve got 40–45 words in a tweet. Three of those is 120–130 words. Five tweets is 200–225 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down your ideas.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a &lt;code&gt;#writing/ideas&lt;/code&gt; tag in &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8" title="Bear by Shiny Frog on the App Store"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and new ideas I have just get thrown in there. When I have a day where I don’t have some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; specific idea to tackle, I browse through that list and grab something that seems interesting. As an example: my &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html"&gt;“Chrome is Not the Standard”&lt;/a&gt; post had just been sitting in there for a couple months when I finally got around to writing it up a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay with being brief.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a wordy guy, but I think many people feel the need to write &lt;em&gt;much longer&lt;/em&gt; material now than they did in the early days of blogging, precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; Twitter exists. It’s as if the existence of a microblogging platform makes us feel like a 200-word post doesn’t justify its own existence. I don’t believe that: &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/momentum.html" title="Momentum"&gt;I write short posts sometimes!&lt;/a&gt; And some of &lt;a href="http://blog.ayjay.org"&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/"&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/many-ways-learn/"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; regularly do likewise.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be okay taking a while to finish.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes a piece can take a few weeks (or months!) to gel. That’s okay. Keep at it. Take some of your allocated writing time and keep plugging. That’s how I finally finished &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="“Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins”"&gt;this book review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But finish things.&lt;/strong&gt; That means: get them to a spot where you’re ready to post them (even if they’re not perfect [because they never are!]) or eventually just throw them away. Both are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block out some time for it!&lt;/strong&gt; The main reason for my flurry of posts of late is that &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html" title="Knowing Your Rhythms"&gt;I started writing every day before 7am&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a habit I’m keeping! It helps. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; scripts. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/four-languages/"&gt;technical writing&lt;/a&gt;. Some days it’ll be &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/star-wars-the-internet-and-me.html" title="Star Wars, the Internet, and Me"&gt;reflections on _Star Wars_&lt;/a&gt;. But blocking out the time means &lt;em&gt;writing will happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post itself is under five hundred words!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I’m breaking these down into three big categories this year, having learned from the experience of summarizing my goals for last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standing aims&lt;/strong&gt;: things that I can’t exactly check off as &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;, but which are extremely important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;: things I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; mark as done.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary:&lt;/strong&gt; the most important of my goals—the ones I’ll count myself as having failed in some way if I don’t accomplish them over the course of the year (barring &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; unforeseen goings-on, which are, well… impossible to foresee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible&lt;/strong&gt;: other goals, which I’d &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to get to, but which it won’t bother me if I don’t get to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section id="standing-aims" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Standing aims&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate well into our new church—including finding specific ways and places to serve regularly, joining a small group, and making some good friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more, better, and more consistent time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="primary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Primary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship a minimum of 3 episodes of New Rustacean per month January—October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish Winning Slowly Season 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish at least 4 medium-length (2,000–3,500 words) at Mere Orthodoxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get ember-cli-typescript “finished”—i.e. with full support for addons and fast incremental builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship a &lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design"&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; version of a major application I work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read, or finish reading, the following books:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resurrection and Moral Order&lt;/em&gt;, Oliver O’Donovan (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology and the Mirror of Scripture&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin Vanhoozer and Daniel Treier (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Buildings Learn&lt;/em&gt;, Stewart Brand (started in 2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of God&lt;/em&gt;, Augustine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Technological Society&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of the City&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ethics of Freedom&lt;/em&gt;, Jacques Ellul&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blasphemy: A Radical Critique of our Technological Culture&lt;/em&gt;, Ivan Illich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitness:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish the &lt;a href="http://www.childrenscoloradofoundation.org/courage-classic/"&gt;Courage Classic&lt;/a&gt; with my dad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get back to my target/healthiest weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="flexible" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flexible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish one essay at a larger publication (for money, if possible!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive static versions of the prior versions of my website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the page load performance of this site (e.g. with progressive font-loading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make meaningful progress on &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; November–December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a book club at Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get up to 20 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print hard copies of at least one year of my website archive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; to go after this year. One thing that isn’t apparent here is that a fair bit of this is aimed at goals that extend past this year. There are things I want to do in the first half of my thirties if possible, of which some of these are a part. I don’t have those kinds of things written down (and when I write them down, I probably won’t publish them here!) but as I come into the broad swath of life that is just “adulthood”—not &lt;em&gt;young&lt;/em&gt; adulthood or &lt;em&gt;old age&lt;/em&gt;—I am increasingly mindful of the kinds of things I want to do that take more than a single year to accomplish. Some of these move the needle substantially in that direction, so hopefully I’ll get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

Thinking about how this year went and what I accomplished, and how I would like the next year to go and what I would like to accomplish &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, has become an important part of my life. There is value in taking stock and making plans—as long as you hold those plans loosely. And this particular set of reflections majors on holding plans loosely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start seems to be with a review of my goals for 2017, set out &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html" title="2016 in Review, Part 6: Plans for 2017"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In a post later this week, I’ll write up some thoughts on what I hope to accomplish in 2018—though, as you’ll see, there are some hints of that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note: there are many things going on in our lives that don’t end up in these reflections—because these reflections (as I conceive them at present, at least) are about the kind of public-facing things I did this year. A blog is not a journal, even if there are some analogies between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="major-goals" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Major goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t really a thing you can ever call &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; in a real sense; there’s always more to do. But we did it well this year, and better than any previous year. I’m looking forward to building on the foundation we laid this year as we move into 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="3" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have much the same to say here as I do about family time. I’ll add that we did move across country and join a new church (and a new denomination!), and I expect to write at much greater length about the convictions which drove the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; we landed on our new congregation after moving across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="4" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shipped a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of code this year, including making some pretty significant architectural contributions for the main app I work on—laying the foundation for it to transition from being a &lt;em&gt;mobile&lt;/em&gt; web application to being a &lt;em&gt;responsive, progressive&lt;/em&gt; web application in 2018. I also built &lt;a href="https://true-myth.js.org"&gt;True Myth&lt;/a&gt; and made some pretty substantial progress on &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/typing-your-ember/" title="Typing Your Ember"&gt;TypeScript in Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="5" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done!&lt;/strong&gt; And, to our surprise relative to the beginning of the year, we’re moving in less than a month from now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start="6" type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I basically ended up putting Lightning on hold entirely this year. New Rustacean and all of the things we had to do around moving just left me with insufficient time to make any sustained progress on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="minor-goals" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minor goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average… done.&lt;/strong&gt; But only on average. I put out a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more episodes in November and December than any other month, courtesy of the &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/show_notes/interview/rbr_2017/index.html"&gt;micro-interviews&lt;/a&gt; I conducted at &lt;a href="https://rust-belt-rust.com"&gt;Rust Belt Rust&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the year, I did publish quite a few episodes, but not nearly as many as I would have liked – more like an average of 1–1.5 each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very much &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; done.&lt;/strong&gt; Winning Slowly did not go &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; the way we thought this year. Our ambitions were… ambitious, given we were both planning to finish graduate degrees and knew that &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; Stephen and possibly &lt;em&gt;both of us&lt;/em&gt; would be moving across the country. Total episodes published this year: 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com" title="City of Oaks Marathon"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; The spring ended up busier and, most importantly, more unpredictable schedule-wise than I hoped, and than allowed for sufficiently regular exercise as to be ready for a triathlon in the summer. And our move across the country both eliminated the final six weeks of training I would have needed for the marathon, and also left us 1,800 miles away from the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not sure!&lt;/strong&gt; I haven’t done a max set in a few months. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been doing a bunch of push-ups and pull-ups since arriving in Colorado, so… maybe. I’ll edit this in a couple days after I do a max set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadly, not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I have not yet gotten a good handle on what &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; dietary changes I’ll need to make to accomplish this goal, but the ones I tried this year didn’t do the trick. I’ll try something new in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done:&lt;/strong&gt; I made a fair bit of progress at the beginning of the year, but this is a &lt;em&gt;mammoth&lt;/em&gt; task. That said, it’s on my radar to try to help drive it forward (hopefully with community involvement) in 2018—it would be great for a complete and accurate reference to be part of the Rust 2019 epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; In particular, I fixed the last couple bugs and tightened things down in the implementation of &lt;a href="https://holybible.com"&gt;HolyBible.com&lt;/a&gt;. While there’s a lot—oh is there a lot!—I would do differently now (3 years after I finished the base implementation of the app), I’m really delighted that in the last six months I’ve had exactly zero bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt; this was an intentional choice as we started into the year, because there were a couple other guys who it was more helpful to have in that role for their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; training. I’ve taught a lot over the years, and both of those guys are going to be actively in church-planting roles in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done.&lt;/strong&gt; I published &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/rhythms-family-worship/" title="The Rhythms of Family Worship"&gt;one essay on our family worship&lt;/a&gt; and another (just last week), &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins"&gt;a book review essay&lt;/a&gt; on William T. Cavanaugh and James K. A. Smith’s _Evolution and the Fall_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; expect to tackle this in 2018, but it just ended up not being a high priority in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; Same as with the New Rustacean ebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started, but incomplete.&lt;/strong&gt; I pulled those archives down for the Blogger site, but have yet to do some systematic cleanup on the &lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;. (This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; actually happen by the end of the year, depending on what all I do on my week off, but as of the time I’m drafting this, it’s not done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not done.&lt;/strong&gt; I did get a Linode server configured, on which I’m running our family blog (&lt;a href="https://krycho.com"&gt;krycho.com&lt;/a&gt;), and which I should pretty easily be able to use for other non-static sites going forward. Though, as I’ve thought about it over the last year and change: it’s likely I’ll split it up into a small handful, with one consisting of a kind of “shared hosting” for the various friends’ WordPress blogs I host; and one consisting of my own and my family’s sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="in-summary" class="level3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year didn’t really go as we thought it would. A lot of that came down to finding a house plan we loved and could build on a lot that we equally loved—it shifted financial and temporal priorities alike. Add in some pretty serious family health issues in my extended family, and, well, no surprise some of my plans and goals didn’t pan out. That’s how it goes! The point of making these kinds of goals, for me, isn’t so much that I accomplish everything on my list as it is taking time to orient myself and to choose what I will and won’t &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; on in the year ahead. And in 2017, I did focus on many of the things on this list. Some of them ended up more important than expected; others less. Interestingly and importantly, though, almost nothing I really spent my time focusing on &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; on the list. And that’s why I keep doing this year after year!&lt;/p&gt;

In that time, I’ve managed to (finally!) publish a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/faithful-extension-question-human-origins/" title="Faithful Extension and the Question of Human Origins: Cavanaugh and Smith’s Evolution and the Fall"&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; I had been planning to tackle (and had abortively started more than once) for months; I have written almost as many words as I have the whole rest of the year; and I published &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/chrome-is-not-the-standard.html" title="Chrome is not the Standard"&gt;one post&lt;/a&gt; that apparently &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15980653"&gt;struck a nerve&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that has become obvious is that &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;my initial surmise&lt;/a&gt; was correct: the early morning &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best time for me to be writing, and I get a lot of mileage out of taking anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes to get at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little post is a reflection not just on that upside, though, but on rolling with the punches. It’s now 7:30pm, and I didn’t write at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; this morning… because I didn’t sleep much last night. My little sister and her husband are in town with their 7-year-old and 3-week-old… and the 3-week-old, one room over from us, slept about the way 3-week-old babies tend to. Add in a 3:45am call from my wife and kids who had to &lt;a href="http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Fire-forces-evacuation-at-Dallas-Love-Field-465891633.html"&gt;evacuate the airport for a fire alarm&lt;/a&gt; where they were trying to fly home from visiting family, and the need then to drive up to the airport to get them, and my normal writing block simply didn’t exist. So here I am some 13 hours later, trying to just write a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit today anyway, because even after just these couple weeks I have come to value getting out some words every day. After I finish this little post, I’ll see if I can knock out another section of the New Rustacean episode I’m drafting for early January, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Productivity” often looks like this: just a bit at a time, day after day; and doing a little even when you don’t really feel like it, just so you keep some forward motion going. Here’s to a lot of keeping-up-that-momentum in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Krycho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 19:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:v4.chriskrycho.com,2017-12-22:/2017/momentum.html</guid><category>productivity</category><category>writing</category></item><item><title>A Little Status Update</title><link>http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/a-little-status-update.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a little status update: I’m a few days into &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;my new routine&lt;/a&gt; of blocking out the time before 7am for writing projects—and so far it’s &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve been able to make progress on a writing project&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that has stymied me for months and months. Yesterday and today alike I wrote 600–700 words in roughly an hour (and words I’m relatively happy with, at that). All my previous efforts at this had come to about 600 words in total, largely in outline form, and when I’d taken a stab at it other than that I’d eventually given up and thrown away anything I’d written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pleasant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/knowing-your-rhythms.html"&gt;Knowing your rhythms&lt;/a&gt; is useful, it turns out; even more useful is taking advantage of them to actually get things done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I’m noticing (as I write at about 6:45pm, in one of those “just okay” spans I mentioned in that post) is that my mind is ticking along again in what I’ve historically called “writing mode.” The idea of sitting down and knocking out a few hundred words of (admittedly self-indulgent) blogging has not seemed relaxing or fun in quite some time. But that’s changing a bit as I stretch those muscles again. I’ve drawn the analogy often enough in the past, but I’ll repeat it once more: writing is very much like exercising. The act of simply &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; it day over day helps reopen pathways in the mind (like running down paths in the woods, perhaps?) and every day you do it makes the next day easier than it otherwise would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now: off to work on a New Rustacean episode script, because the juices are flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

Between 6am and 10am, and from roughly 8pm to midnight, I am at my most alert and most mentally capable. By contrast, 10am to 1pm is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, and 1pm to 4pm is &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; and 4pm to 8pm is back to &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. I can get things done in that span, but it’s very difficult especially to do things like writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also can’t get by on only 6 hours of sleep, so a lot of my best time isn’t available to me one way or the other. In general that means that if I want to write or otherwise do really creative work, I have limited options. Since, as &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/why-do-i-need-a-research-tool.html" title="Why Do I Need a Research Tool?"&gt;I noted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I’m aiming to be doing a fair bit of research and writing over the next few years, I need at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that time. That goes for the thinking-and-writing-intensive work of preparing for New Rustacean episodes, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my job allows me considerable flexibility, I can’t just take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the time for side projects, whether those research projects, or working on New Rustacean. Too: my evening concentration ability is much lower than my morning concentration ability, because I’m also the dad of two small children, and between finishing working in the late afternoon and getting them to bed around 7:30–8:00pm, I am much drained mentally. (Kids are awesome, but they can be exhausting!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to try something: every day starting this week and running through the end of the month (whether I’m working or not), the time before 7am is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. After making breakfast for me and my wife, and reading my Bible for some time, I’m going to use that time to work on reading and research, blogging and longer-form writing, New Rustacean prep, and the like. If, by the end of this month, I evaluate that it’s going well (I rather suspect it will be), I’ll formalize that as something to keep doing in the next year. (Accordingly, I’ll report back on how it has gone so far in my usual end-of-year writeup!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, at least, it already feels like something of a win to have gotten some words out here at the start of the day, and I feel far more &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to write now than I normally do after a full work day during that mid-to-late afternoon mental slump!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve been a fairly steady practitioner of the habit of marking what I do in any given 25-minute work cycle. However, I’ve felt of late that while I usually had a good sense of what my goals had been and whether I had accomplished them for any given small &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of the day, I didn’t have a clear sense of what I had done over the day as a whole—much less at the end of a whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just started summarizing it at the end of each day, or early the next day, and pulling those summaries into a single document at the end of the week. (If you’re curious, I’ve been doing all of this in &lt;a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, which of course I use in its Markdown mode.) So on any given Friday, I can actually look at my week as a whole and have some concrete sense of what I’ve accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve only done this for the past three weeks, but I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like it and I intend to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing I need to figure out how to integrate into it is non-work tasks. And really, that goes for my life in general right now. I’m &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/on-decompression.html" title="On Decompression"&gt;still sorting through&lt;/a&gt; what it looks like to just be working a full-time job and having a few side projects. But I’d like to be able to look back at the end of each month and boil down those weekly summaries, and at the end of the year likewise with the months—and from the combination, actually know a bit more concretely what my year was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how it goes. I’m sure I’ll be back with more to say in this space soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-4.html"&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017! (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I really only have a few big goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend good time with my family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love our church well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work hard for Olo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save money for a house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of smaller goals, too, of course. That list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish two episodes of New Rustacean every month (of various formats—not all the full-length teaching-a-subject type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish 16–20 episodes of Winning Slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complete a full-length sprint triathlon&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to do 15 consecutive pull-ups and 100 consecutive push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lose ten pounds and get back down to my target weight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document all the undocumented features in Rust, and get the Rust reference all the way up to date (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;tracking issue&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finish a couple side projects (and bring in the associated money!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teach in our small group at least a half dozen times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write at least one long essay for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish the scripts and transcripts of New Rustacean as an ebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publish hard copies of the archives of my blog, in a way that mirrors the style of the site at the time it was written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully archive the Blogger and WordPress versions of this blog as static HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move all the sites I host (mine and others) out of shared hosting and into a server I manage (probably Digital Ocean or Linode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically all of those are flexible (and, if I’m honest, so is #6 in the first list—though it’s a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; priority as far as the flexible ones go).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty good handle on how I’m going to chase those things. The productivity patterns I’ve established over the last couple years are serving me well so far, and I expect them to continue to. After graduation, things will obviously look a little different, and I’m looking forward to that, too. Being able to take vacations where I’m not losing ground by not working on school projects? That sounds truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking forward to digging into more books I want to read and making progress on writing I want to do in the realm of theology, philosophy, ethics, and so on. I’ve spent nearly all the mental energy I have available for those subjects on seminary work over the past several years (with varying degrees of value for that effort). Once again being able to focus my own external studies as I like will be very freeing, I think. I hope to find some ways to continue to work at something like an academic level, and—crazy though it sounds right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;—I do hope to get a Ph.D. in &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in a few decades. But I am looking forward to having a lot of years of reading and writing outside academia between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those goals are good, but ultimate I’m willing to just see what the year brings. I’d love to compose music again more regularly and at greater length. I’d love to write more fiction, and more (and better) poetry. But we’ll also be starting some schooling with Ellie, and dealing with the logistics of planning a move to Colorado sometime in late 2017 or the first half of 2018. We’ll be enjoying just not having nearly so much to do right after finishing seminary. It’s worth remembeirng to rest, and not do just jump into another season of being incredibly slammed by busyness. I plan to take some time to read novels and play video games, too. Those things are good for our souls in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And come what may, I hope to glorify God in the midst of it. Rest, work, play, side projects, you name it—&lt;em&gt;soli deo gloria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a number of points over the last few years, I’ve tackled the question of productivity. I always have far more I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to get done than I’m able to actually get to. A few of those posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;Boosting My Productivity&lt;/a&gt; (December, 2014)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;A New Schedule: Trying to make better use of my time toward my goals&lt;/a&gt; (July 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of all productivity plans, of course, is that one can get more focused on the details of the plan than on actually being productive! I’m happy to say, however, that this &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; the case for me with these productivity approaches. First, I have never allowed myself to be slavish about them. If I need to do something different on a given day, I do something different. Second, I am generally able to remember that the point of the plan is &lt;em&gt;what I’m getting done&lt;/em&gt;. So with that in mind, some comments particularly on the plan I sketched out &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-new-schedule.html" title="A New Schedule"&gt;mid-year this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell off that wagon almost immediately. Readers who’ve stuck with me through these various updates will note that this ambitious plan preceded my disastrous 20-mile run and the ensuing bout of walking pneumonia by a matter of days. It took me until September to get back on the horse, so to speak, because even after I got over being sick, I was traveling—and nothing throws off my schedule like traveling! Happily, I got quite a bit done both during the conference trip I took and during the week I was in Colorado for my youngest sister’s wedding, but it wasn’t until after both of those that I was able to settle back into the routine I’d aimed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major themes of that post were a detailed plan for my days, cutting out a lot of my social media, and thinking about weekends. The detailed plan for my days I kept off and on. I never consistently managed to have the block of time-for-side-projects at the end of my days, and that increasingly meant those things cut into weekends (impacting that goal as well). As for social media, that’s largely been a success: I now rarely get on Facebook, and only check Twitter from time to time. Certainly neither is much of a timesink anymore. I do continue to make heavy use of Slack outside of work, but I’ve found a good balance there (and the main communities I’m a part of have gone through their own adjustments as we’ve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; found the need for this kind of focus and balance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it wasn’t perfect, but I did find it a very useful approach overall. I fully expect to stick with something very like it in 2017. Hopefully I won’t be pulling as many 10–11 hour days as I was in the latter half of 2016—but regardless, building this new discipline around the overall structure of each day was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; part of my approach to productivity that I’m definitely going to keep is the “pomodoro” technique. I first mentioned this in the &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html" title="Boosting My Productivity"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; discussion I posted about this, but I’ve embraced it more and more. I work in 25-minute blocks, punctuated by 5-minute breaks. Nearly all of those 5-minute breaks entail walking, and as a result I get about 2–3 miles of walking in every day on top of my runs. That helps enormously with focus. This fall, I also embraced the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; half of the pomodoro technique: writing down goals and outcomes for each of those 25-minute blocks. Even more than the daily goals I discussed in the opening post of this series, this lower level of tracking has proved very helpful. It has given me a sense of what I have actually accomplished each day, and it has also helped me &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; as I’m trying to keep moving on various tasks each day. I highly recommend using the pomodoro approach (adapted as necessary to your particular circumstances, of course) as a tool for that kind of focus and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be remiss if I didn’t also note the following &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; substantial factors in my productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fitness/health:&lt;/strong&gt; if I’m active, I focus better. People say they don’t have time to exercise; I mean it when I say I don’t have time &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to. I keep it pretty simple: running, cycling, swimming, and body-weight strength stuff. But I do it basically every day. And we eat fairly healthily. Both of those are incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; no matter how busy I am, I don’t pull all-nighters or anything of the sort. I get a minimum of 6 and usually 7–7½ hours of sleep every night. Even when I’m tired from pulling week after week of 10-hour work days, I can keep going because I get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no commute:&lt;/strong&gt; working remotely is awesome for a lot of reasons, but one of them is that I don’t lose the hour or three every day to the road/subway/etc. that many people I know do. That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time over the course of a year. 48 working weeks means if you commute for an hour total every day, that’s 240 hours a year—that’s 30 8-hour days worth of “getting things done”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point after I finish seminary I will expand the various things I do in productivity into a more complete series, but this gives you a good idea of what 2016 looked like, and what I expect 2017 to look like!&lt;/p&gt;

As such, I’ve broken it into a series of posts, to be published daily through the start of the new year. Hopefully they’re a bit more digestible that way!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;Part 2: So. many. words. I had no idea how many words.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-3.html"&gt;Part 3: Podcasting: Winning Slowly, New Rustacean, and more!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source. (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at Olo was a great year overall. I very much enjoy working with the people there, the tech stack is good and they’re paying me to do what I love, and if the product isn’t lighting my world on fire (online restaurant ordering is cool, but restaurants aren’t a passion of mine), that’s a tradeoff I can live with. Working with good people with a good tech stack on a product you find &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; is actually pretty great. I’m grateful for previous jobs, but this one has superceded them in every possible way. I’m &lt;em&gt;glad&lt;/em&gt; to start work every day—and in truth, there have been more than a few days where I would have liked nothing more than to keep writing JavaScript rather than switching over to do some reading and writing for seminary. That bodes well for my future plans: post-seminary, I expect to bump from 30 to 40 hours a week with Olo&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and keep making our software as awesome as I can. And I expect to enjoy that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of numbers: GitHub reports that I contributed +29,463/−13,726 lines of code in our new mobile web ordering experience, which I helped build nearly from scratch this year. (That “negative” is stuff I rewrote or removed entirely by finding a better implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a bit of my &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; this year was technical, too: some ~33,000 of the words on my blog—fully a third of the things I published on this site apart from microblog posts and schoolwork—was about software. That included entries 11–18 of my &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, but about 20,000 words were assorted discussions of JavaScript, Rust, podcasting, functional programming, etc. A fair bit of that content came out of things I worked on for Olo, either directly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html" title="What is Functional Programming? (And why should we care about it?)"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;) or indirectly (as in the case of &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/keyof-and-mapped-types-in-typescript-21.html" title="keyof and Mapped Types in TypeScript 2.1"&gt;this discussion of TypeScript 2.1&lt;/a&gt;) That’s a good mix, and I hope to continue putting out material that’s useful to others as well as interesting to me. (I do get tweets now and again confirming that the content is helpful, and I &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; run analytics on the site at all—so if you like something I write, please tell me. It’s encouraging. And that goes for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; author you read, as a rule.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I actually did a little bit of open-source contributing this year. Not as much as I’d like, but a little. And I also count New Rustacean as a pretty substantial contribution to the Rust community. The fact that it isn’t code doesn’t diminish what it’s doing. If you’re feeling like code is the only thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; counts, recognize that all the code in the world isn’t that useful without explanations of how to use it, helping people become interested in the first place, and so on. Speaking of non-code contributions, the open-source contribution I’m &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; proud of is certainly the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1636"&gt;Rust RFC&lt;/a&gt; I wrote and which was recently accepted and merged. It proposed (and it is now the official policy of the Rust project) that no new features may be added to the (stable version of the) language or the standard library without first being documented. This is a big deal for the language, and it was also a big deal for me, in that it was another place where—despite being far too busy to write a lot of Rust code this year—I could make a real difference in a community I’m passionate about. And one of my goals for next year is a direct follow-on from that: &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38643"&gt;actually implementing the requirement&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big thing going on for me in the software world is that I started work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a new static site generator in Rust. (There’s another such project, &lt;a href="http://cobalt-org.github.io"&gt;Cobalt&lt;/a&gt;, which is already usable.) I’ve been pushing up against the limits of &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, my current generator, for a while. And I’ve looked around time and again, and never found a CMS or SSG that does everything my peculiar publishing needs require (&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a way that I like!). And my needs are indeed peculiar, though probably not wholly unique; for most people, any one of &lt;a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; other site generators&lt;/a&gt; would work just fine. So I’m doing what I’ve been thinking about doing for years, and building my own. My immediate goals are mostly just to have something that is super speedy and which checks off all my needs from a CMS/site generator. My longer-term goals include getting some good foundational knowledge I’ll need for &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/ulysses-byword-and-just-right.html"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; project&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a thousand lines in, and have some pieces working. I hope very much to move off of Pelican and onto Lightning (and get a freshened theme for this site) in 2017!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Olo has been incredibly generous and hired me as a full-time employee at 30-hours-a-week with pro-rated salary. Like I said: amazing company.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 3: Podcasting: Winning Slowly, New Rustacean, and more! (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-4.html"&gt;Part 4: Writing software for Olo and for open source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-2.html"&gt;the written word&lt;/a&gt;, the other “writing”-type work I had this year—some of it including &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; writing in the form of detailed scripts—was podcasting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Show&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Episodes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Total time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;11h 40m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;6h 46m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;Run With Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1h 1m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;sap.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;12m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;67&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19h 39m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, several of those numbers surprised me a bit. For one thing, I had to put New Rustacean on hiatus starting in October courtesy of the crunch I ended up with from the &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project colliding with the other summer-and-fall commitments I had. For another Stephen and I paused Winning Slowly between Seasons 4 and 5 (as we usually do) and also have taken a mid-season pause on Season 5 because of end-of-semester crunches for both of us and then his wife having a baby a few weeks earlier than expected. Yet in spite of that, almost 20 hours of audio content this year! If I hit that again in 2017, I’ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;a href="http://www.sap-py.com"&gt;sap.py&lt;/a&gt; will be back, I have no idea. I love making the show with Jaimie, but it’s really up to her whether she wants to keep working on Python. Of late, she’s been working on &lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PemberlyPrintables" title="Jaimie&amp;#39;s printable shop on Etsy"&gt;printable art&lt;/a&gt; instead, and that’s delightful in its own right. I’ve &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/14/"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; gotten &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;Run With Me&lt;/a&gt; going again in the past day; I got off track when my headphone microphone stopped working for a bit and never got back &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; track when it started working again. I’m looking forward to once again talking about running while running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be publishing an even wider variety of kinds of episodes of New Rustacean in 2017. Listeners should get another couple of interviews, a lot more of the “here is a Rust concept in detail” episodes (at least one a month in general, I hope!), news episodes, undoubtedly a few bonus episodes, and a new “Crates You Should Know” format designed to highlight crates I’ve found useful in my own Rust work. I continue to find Rust a wonderful language, and I hear regularly that this is one of people’s favorite programming podcasts. I hope to keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to wrap up &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-5.html" title="Winning Slowly Season 5: Structure and Agency"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; mid-spring, and then begin recording Season 6 mid-to-late summer. All of that is pending how things go as Stephen finishes his dissertation and likely prepares to move across the country to take a job as a professor somewhere, of course. But that’s the plan—and yes, we already know the rough shape of Season 6, even this far out. We know the season topic, and have some basic ideas of where we want to go with it. As is usually the case with our “seasons” now, it will take ideas we’ve touched on here and there and turn them into a full-blown, months-long exploration of those ideas as applied to specific issues. Winning Slowly remains one of my very favorite projects, not least because there is (to our knowledge) nothing else out there doing quite the same thing. Tackling long-term trends in technology with a distinctively (though not always overtly) Christian perspective (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a reductionist one) is apparently our gap to fill. We’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other podcasting-related bits. First, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/theses-on-podcasting/" title="32 Theses (and several more words) on Podcasting"&gt;~5,000-word piece for Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt; explaining how the medium works, what its constraints are, and what is involved in doing it well. If podcasting is interesting to you, I think the piece is well worth your time—precisely because of, and not in spite of, its length! Second, I gave a pair of guest lectures for Stephen at N.C. State University this fall, which are both available in the &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/season-bonus.html"&gt;bonus section&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;. Those cover some of the same ground as the piece at Mere O, but they also talk a lot more about the details of finding a topic, an “authorial voice”, and an angle for your show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2016 was to continue writing not only on this blog but in other outlets. I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of writing this year, but relatively little of it is published. But here’s a look at some of the numbers! Note that “This site” excludes republication of school papers, and that I don’t have an exact count for the school papers because I’ve already discarded a few of the shorter pieces, but their average length is well-known to me. More on the unpublished &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project below.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class="header"&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Words&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~130,500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="even"&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;~6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~207,850&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the writing for school, only a small fraction of it is &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/m-div/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt;, unlike previous years. Roughly 75,000 words of that content is research notes I put together for an independent study I did—which was deeply profitable for me in terms of thinking through hermeneutical and theological systems, and which will hopefully be helpful for the professor for whom I prepared them, but which are not at all publishable. Another 10,000 of those words fit in a category charitably describable as “busy-work” and publishing them is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; but would have no &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;. The school-writing also includes the notes and manuscripts for my sermon-delivery class. You can find those sermons &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/sermons/"&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt; as well well, with audio, video, and the manuscripts available—but the notes are not worth publishing, as they’re entirely internal. Still: they’re words, I wrote them, and there are a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I wrote one of the papers I’m proudest of from my entire seminary career in the spring: &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/realism-and-antirealism.html"&gt;Realism and Antirealism—A key debate in the philosophy of science (with interesting implications for young-earth creationism)&lt;/a&gt;. I’m happy with it not least because I wrote it in a very compressed fashion because of some family health issues that hit at the end of that semester, and it still turned out extremely well because I had &lt;em&gt;planned&lt;/em&gt; it meticulously. Despite having only a single draft with one typo-level revision pass, it’s easily the best paper I’ve ever written. It turns out that doing a really careful outline helps when you’re working at this scale. I’ve not normally been a fan of outlining (and I’ve not normally found it helpful when I’ve tried it), but for any longer, more sustained argument, it’s absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the content on this site (excluding republication of school papers), an astounding ~14,000 of those words are in my “microblog” content. It’s amazing how much those little posts add up. That said, I’m surprised to see that I’ve put out as many &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; words as I have this year on this site, and the total there is rather staggering. Writing on this site includes everything from &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/ask.html" title="Ask: a short story"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/to-paint-god-as-a-man.html" title="To paint God as a man: an Advent poem"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/a-simple-childrens-catechism.html"&gt;a simple children’s catechism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/what-is-functional-programming.html"&gt;an introduction to functional programming&lt;/a&gt;. I’m exceptionally pleased in retrospect to see how this came out, and I look forward to writing on equally varied terms in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 13,000 of the words I wrote for this site were in my &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/rust-and-swift.html"&gt;Rust and Swift&lt;/a&gt; series, a project I’ve enjoyed enormously since starting it in 2015 and would like to get back to in 2017. It went on hold because I was offered, and accepted, a contract to write a 30–40 page report for O’Reilly comparing the two languages, which was intended to come out this fall. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way some wires got crossed and my pitch and what they wanted didn’t end up being the same. Once that became clear (at the beginning of October), they opted to drop the project. This was a huge disappointment to me: it was a small hit financially, but a big one time-wise, as I sunk a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of hours into it in what was an already-very-busy fall; the project was over ¾ done when it was dropped.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few big lessons I learned from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overcommit. Even if the project had gone through without issue, it would have been more on my plate than I could reasonably handle. The fact that it was canceled after having done a lot of the work meant it was also &lt;em&gt;financially&lt;/em&gt; frustrating, but I had overcommitted regardless. Won’t do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; clear up-front about the terms and goals of a project. I don’t know how we ended up with the crossed wires we did, but it was extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can get an advance, get an advance. Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I’m quite pleased with the &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt; of my output in 2016 (who wouldn’t be, right?). I’d definitely like a lot more of that to be public-facing in 2017, even if it’s lower in overall volume. I hope to take the material from that canceled &lt;em&gt;Rust vs. Swift&lt;/em&gt; project, expand it slightly, and self-publish it. I also hope to put together at least one substantive essay for Mere Orthodoxy next year. And of course there will probably be thousands of words in this space, too—inevitably more than I even realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note as well that this excludes all the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com/tree/589cd13225cde91f92bfca93f6679f2395d78886/docs"&gt;podcast scripts&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this year! Those would add well over 10,000 more words to this count.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that number includes these posts!&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted an analysis of when you’d choose each language; I pitched a comparison along similar lines to my blog series, looking at the language design choices as a view into software engineering tradeoffs. When the mismatch became clear, I pointed out that “when to choose Rust vs. Swift” is, generally speaking, a roughly two-sentence answer: “Choose Rust for cross-platform, high-performance/low-level code. Choose Swift if you’re writing apps on an Apple platform.” This was not, apparently, obvious to everyone else involved. In the words of the internet: &lt;span style="whitespace: nowrap"&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-intro.html"&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-5.html"&gt;Part 5: Getting things done in 2016 and beyond.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, hold on,&lt;/em&gt; you say. &lt;em&gt;Go back. How did you get walking pneumonia?&lt;/em&gt; This is a fun story, and it’s a huge part of what made the other parts of the latter half of 2016 go the way they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for what I expected to be a 15–16 mile long run as part of training for the half-marathon I signed up for this year. The previous week &lt;a href="http://runwith.chriskrycho.com/runs/12/" title="Run summary on runwith.chriskrycho.com"&gt;I’d done a 14-mile run&lt;/a&gt;, so 15–16 would have been no problem. I was feeling &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; on the run, so decided to extend it to 17. This was right at the edge of what makes good sense for a week-over-week increase in mileage; you generally want to stick with ~10% increases and max out at 20%; but 17 is right at that limit relative to 14. So I turned right to cut through another nearby town instead of left to head directly home when I was at roughly the 11-mile mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, where I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; cut back toward home, I took a wrong turn out of a five-way intersection. (You can see on the north end of the map, in Youngsville, &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/644619792" title="Run overview on Strava"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I realized this half a mile on, but figured there would be a spot to cut over. There is not. So I got back to where I had taken the wrong turn, filled up my water bottle and hit the bathroom, and made my way home. But at this point, I was already at ~15 miles, and ~4 miles from home. As I got back into our town, I decided: why not just go ahead and extend out to 20 miles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is, that extra three quarters of a mile probably didn’t matter a bit. 19.25 vs. 20 miles? Same difference in its effect on my immune system, which is to say: it completely crashed it. A 42% week over week increase in mileage is no joke. The little cold I picked up from my 2-year-old daughter turned into borderline bronchitis. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What with a busy spring preceding—I had no idea how much busier I would be taking 2 classes and working 30 hours a week than I had been taking 3 classes and working 20 hours a week—I didn’t manage a triathlon. I had contented myself with the thought that I’d likely set another PR in my half marathon, but after weeks of recovery from walking pneumonia, that thought fell apart as well. I lost about a minute per mile in my pace, and my mileage was shot as well. I never got it back—not least because of a writing project which went south on me. I ended up being sick off and on all fall, and I’m only now getting my feet back under me. Sad to say, one of those times I got sick was the week of the half marathon I signed up for, and I’d been getting loud, clear signals from my body on previous runs that I was pushing too hard. So no race &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; this year. But better that than pushing and injuring myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year also saw a so-far unreversed weight gain that I find incredibly frustrating. In the first six months of 2016, I gained about ten pounds—despite keeping up the same basic activity level. I attribute this to a combination of factors: metabolic shifts in my late 20s, shifting back to doing almost purely running rather than a mix of running, swimming, and cycling, and the impact of acclimation to a workout load. I’m far from overweight, but I’m also slower and generally a bit flabbier as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping 2017 is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better in all these regards! I plan to do a sprint-length triathlon and a full marathon. And I hope to lose those ten pounds again and get back to that healthier overall weight. That combo seems like the thing to do the year I turn thirty and graduate seminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Introduction, or: a ridiculous year summarized (this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2016/2016-review-1.html"&gt;Part 1: Running headfirst into a wall of pneumonia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/2016-review-6.html"&gt;Part 6: Plans for 2017!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2016 was a long, difficult, strange, sometimes wonderful and sometimes dreadful year for me. It was one of the most professionally and scholastically enjoyable and rewarding years of my life, and also one of the most exhausting. As I often do at years-end, I am taking stock publicly of what went well, what went poorly, and what I might do different in a variety of categories—here, mostly in terms of my public-facing endeavors. This year’s summing-up post will also (for, I think, the first time) include some numbers! But first, a few comments on the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2015/thoughts-on-2015-and-2016.html"&gt;offered a similar set of reflections&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of it, I laid out some plans for 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to set a single goal in each of five major categories in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spiritual:&lt;/strong&gt; everything in my walk with God, including my own personal devotions, my involvement in the life of the church, and my “ministry” actions in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;family:&lt;/strong&gt; both quantity and quality time spent with my wife and my quickly-growing-up little girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;personal:&lt;/strong&gt; podcasting, blogging, and writing for &lt;a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/author/chris-krycho/"&gt;other outlets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;professional:&lt;/strong&gt; working in my new job and as a consultant, and carrying on toward the conclusion of my M. Div.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;health/fitness:&lt;/strong&gt; continuing to stay healthy, including eating well and continuing to stay fit by running and doing triathlon work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I made the habit of writing these out formally on a day-by-day basis—and I did this off and on. If you were to look at my little (Moleskine-branded and delightful-to-me) daily planner, you’d see streaks of weeks where I noted specific tasks and whether I hit them or not, punctuated by weeks and months where I did nothing of the sort. I have always found it difficult to stick with these kinds of things, in part because I usually have a pretty good idea what I need to do on any given day without writing it down somewhere. (I use &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" title="OmniFocus"&gt;other tools&lt;/a&gt; for tracking mid- and long-term deadlines for school.) In July, I started mashing this idea up with &lt;a href="http://bulletjournal.com" title="Bullet Journal site"&gt;bullet journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and I found that I (a) really like the system and (b) also didn’t stick with it consistently. A lot of that came down to the fact that I got thrown off—horribly—by getting a mild-but-still-utterly-debilitating case of walking pneumonia in July. (On which, more in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for last year’s ideas about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I was going to hit those goals. How did I actually do at addressing them? The answer is: &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;. 2016 was not an amazing year. It was not a terrible year. But it had as many downs as ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own walk with God remains &lt;em&gt;steady&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing amazing to report here, but I’m more than okay with that. I will perhaps say more on this in another post, but the older I get the more convinced I am that emotional highs are a trap. Sentiment and true religion are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same thing; and Scripture calls us to &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;spiritual feelings&lt;/em&gt;. As such, in a year with this many bumps, I am glad to say that I had no horrible falls, and I read my Bible nearly every day and prayed every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family learned some Bible verses, and started working on the Heidelberg Catechism. We shared the gospel with people as we were able, and met faithfully with our church. We were not extraordinary, and we were far from flawless, but I think we did &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. I hope and pray in God’s grace we are able to continue in faithfully doing well in the years to come. Certainly if there is one thing I hope to do more of in 2017 it is spend time with my girls. I am not a huge “kid person,” but these years are precious and go by quickly; far better to spend more time with them and have a podcast episode or a writing project go out later (or not at all) than to miss these little years.&lt;/p&gt;

In the aim of being &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more productive with my time, and with the idea that I hit a minimum of 40 hours a week between school and work,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I made the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I embraced a weekly schedule, where each week day includes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time I get up, and a goal for how long it takes me to go from when my alarm goes off to when I have breakfast made for Jaimie and me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;half an hour of Bible reading and devotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five minutes to read the news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five minutes to plan my day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two hours of reading and writing for school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;six hours of software development work for Olo&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a specific workout in my self-designed training plan for the &lt;a href="http://cityofoaksmarathon.com"&gt;half marathon&lt;/a&gt; I am running this fall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an hour dedicated to creative projects I am working on—I’ll fill this with things like writing blog posts, prepping New Rustacean episodes, recording and editing Winning Slowly, and working on building a modern iOS and macOS app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roughly 90 minutes devoted entirely to spending time with my family, over dinner and afterward until our girls go to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;about two hours freely available—this varies enormously: it might include more of those creative endeavors, it might be just hanging out with Jaimie (watching &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; or something) for a few hours, it might be spending time with friends we have over for dinner and time afterward, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep 7–7.5 hours every single night—this is my sweet spot, so hitting it makes a big difference in being able to hit all those other marks throughout the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of small spaces throughout the day during my &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; breaks which I use for other reading (especially news, RSS, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cut nearly all social media: Facebook, Twitter, Slack, and email all receive drastically lower amounts of time now.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; I now check once a week. I may post news stories to it, but I am basically treating it as a “write-only” medium—posting content to it but not interacting there. (I find interactions there to have a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; low ratio of value to time spent.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; I now check once a day, for no more than five minutes. It is incredibly easy to get sucked into reading my Twitter feed at great length, and far more difficult to conclude that using my time that way is remotely valuable for my goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack:&lt;/strong&gt; I now use in dedicated blocks of time. I get very good value out of Slack:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for professional use, as we use it to coordinate our work at Olo, and it’s very handy for quick interactions for a distributed team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for side projects: Stephen and I use it to coordinate and plan for &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and I also provide a fair bit of input and discussion for &lt;a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com"&gt;Mere Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as occasionally write there (you may see something of that sort this very week, in fact).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for personal use, as a virtual water cooler with a bunch of other developers in one team, and with a group of Christians in tech in another, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; helpful for staying sane while working at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All that notwithstanding, Slack can also be a huge time-sink and distraction, so I limit the blocks I use it, and try to be effective with that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; I now have closed much of the day, and only check at intervals. Especially with the way we get automated emails for various kinds of error reporting, issue tracking, and so on at work, having my mail up all day is a quick path to constant interruption. (Further minimizing notifications from email will help even more on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; thinking about how I want to treat my time on the weekends, as well: dedicated blocks of time with family, for side work I’m doing a little of, for those creative side projects, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot there, and I’ve only been at it one week. So far, however, I like it, and it’s felt like something I can sustain effectively going forward. A few things will have to be tweaked a bit when I’m in class proper in the fall, not just doing an independent study. But the main routine is very good and very helpful so far, and I intend to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other other observation on the changes themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; require a lot of discipline to stick with over the course of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was most helpful because I did take that planning time each day and set specific tasks I wanted to accomplish in that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t quite pull it off all the way; some schedule surprises Thursday and Friday threw it off. I did still get done basically everything I wanted to this week, though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also didn’t manage that full hour-long creative block every day. I managed about 30–45 minutes most days, because I found myself craving some non-thinking time right after wrapping up work. I’ll need to sort that out more as I go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suspect that making this an actual habit will yield huge dividends over time, but it’s going to take a while to make it &lt;em&gt;stick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section id="background" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; did I do all of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I have been feeling, increasingly keenly, the amount I have to get done (work, school, side projects like &lt;a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/"&gt;New Rustacean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.winningslowly.org/"&gt;Winning Slowly&lt;/a&gt; and a few more simmering as well) and the amount of time I have to do it (no more than anyone else). I have also been feeling the effects of too much “multitasking,” which I increasingly recognize along with everyone else is impossible. If I am jumping back and forth between some kind of work (writing software, reading, or writing) and other activities like email, Slack, or Twitter, I simply do not get as much done. But I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a trap of thinking that productivity is the most important thing in the world. It is very American. I understand the temptation, but I do not generally indulge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about accomplishing the particular things I want to do, and doing those as well as being a good husband and dad and a faithful member of our church means using my time as effectively as I can. This is not a new concern for me, and &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2014/boosting-my-productivity.html"&gt;as such I have written about it before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things I wrote about before I still do, and they work well for me. I still use OmniFocus to manage my tasks; I still use the pomodoro approach for keeping my brain moving throughout a whole day, and I still refuse to use email as a task manager (though I’ve been less disciplined about hitting “Inbox Zero” than I’d like of late). However, I found in the past few months that, while good, those habits aren’t quite &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; for everything I have going. They are necessary but insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can manage more on the school front over the weekends, that’s a win, but this breakdown is usually enough to get done everthing I need to.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olo is a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; employer. Among many other things Olo does exceptionally well, they were willing to hire me as a salaried, full-time type employee with full benefits, but working 30 hours instead of 40 while I’m finishing my M. Div. I have pro-rated pay and vacation (though, pro-rated vacation just means I have the same amount of functional time off as everyone else does), but otherwise am just like every other employee in terms of health-care, training availability, laptop, etc. Olo is the best place I’ve ever worked, bar none, and by a &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; margin.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

I needed to be more productive—a lot more. Happily, I have been, and it only took three small changes.&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="use-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use a To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a list of items to accomplish has been incredibly helpful. I started using &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; in August for class due dates and any work tasks not tracked in other ways.&lt;a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At that point, I organized everything—a bit too much, actually. Over the last couple months, I took some good advice I have seen in a number of places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not over-organize. Most tasks can go in a simple inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit your due dates. Making it a habit to hit every due date will help you not to miss important tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not put due dates on things that do not need them. You will eventually stop paying attention to them—and also to the due dates that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to knock out a few small things from my Inbox every day, and hit all the due dates I set for myself. I am missing fewer things, getting more things done, and getting them done sooner than I did before. I like my app, but I know people who have just used an old-fashioned planner. The trick is to find a strategy that works for you.&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="email-is-not-a-to-do-list" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Is &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; A To-Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I got in the habit of using my email as a to-do list. In theory, seeing a list of unanswered emails every day should have motivated me to respond to them. In reality, they just sat there and slowly piled up. At best, they nagged at me. At worst, I basically forgot them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using OmniFocus, I killed this habit. Now I make a task for anything I need to act on, and I delete or archive everything else.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If the task is time-sensitive, I put a due date on it; otherwise, my third rule above applies. I also have a repeating task reminding me to empty my inbox at the end of each day (“Inbox Zero”). Having an empty inbox at the end of every day removes a certain amount of mental baggage: I have a task for everything I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="take-breaks" class="level2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take breaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have started using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;“pomodoro”&lt;/a&gt; technique. The basic approach is to work steadily for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break.&lt;a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After four such cycles, I take a slightly longer break—usually 15 minutes. On each break, I walk around and do something unrelated to whatever I am working on. I also write down a brief summary of what I did on that cycle.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There is nothing complicated about this: I just use a simple timer to track the work and break cycles.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have seen a &lt;em&gt;dramatic&lt;/em&gt; improvement in my ability to sustain my concentration on my tasks throughout the day since I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for that improvement. First, I have dedicated break times, so I know that I can go check social media, read tech and news sites, etc. &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;. That makes it easier to concentrate on work for the blocks in between; the distractions can wait. Second, it puts a limit on those break times. We have all been surprised to find we have lost an hour reading online; using a timer helps prevent that. Third, getting up and moving around helps keep my brain active—I can tell that the movement considerably improves my alertness and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These breaks have other benefits, too. There is mounting evidence that sitting all day is terrible for our health. Even exercising as much as I do &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/25/135575490/sitting-all-day-worse-for-you-than-you-might-think" title="Sitting All Day: Worse For You Than You Might Think"&gt;cannot fully counteract&lt;/a&gt; a sedentary lifestyle. However, there is also evidence that getting up and moving on a regular basis &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; help. Walking briskly, I usually manage a fifth or a quarter of a mile on a five-minute break. That adds up over the course of a day: if I am disciplined about walking on my breaks, I regularly walk 2–3 miles in a day, even with lunch and other non-walking breaks in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also found the breaks spiritually helpful. One of the requirements for my pastoral ministry internship was to memorize Ephesians. Five-minute breaks are &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for memorizing and reviewing Scripture, so I was able to be productive on those breaks, even while letting my brain relax from my other work. It is similarly useful for dedicated times of prayer throughout the day. The combination of scripture memory and prayer has been invaluable in combatting sin and stirring up my affections for Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I get a triple benefit by doing pomodoros. I am more productive when I am working, my body will remain healthier because I am less sedentary, and I am growing in holiness and intimacy with God. Of all the changes I made this semester, incorporating pomodoros into my day has been the most important, and I plan to make it a regular part of my life henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just what I do. It may not work for you. It may even drive you crazy.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e., things not covered by JIRA, Trello, Bitbucket issues, etc.&lt;a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; suits me, I would recommend &lt;a href="https://en.todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; to most people instead: it is less expensive and easier to use, and while it does not do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; OmniFocus does, it can easily do everything most people need.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I archive order confirmations, messages from friends, and work conversations, and delete everything else.&lt;a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the 25/5 pattern? That seems to be a limit in human cognition; it lines up closely with research on student attention spans in the classroom.&lt;a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps me see what I have done over the course of a day and gives me a sense of progress. It is also extremely useful when writing up a weekly report for an employer.&lt;a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="http://www.tomighty.org/"&gt;Tomighty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-one/id907364780?mt=12"&gt;Pomodoro One&lt;/a&gt;, which are both free and work well. The app is not the point, though: an old-fashioned kitchen timer will do just as well.&lt;a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
