If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; In want of a bit of classic sci-fi, I recently picked up Larry Niven’s &lt;cite&gt;Ringworld&lt;/cite&gt; and read it this week. I enjoyed it, but more than that I find it hard to say. I’m still not sure exactly what to describe it as: an exploratory high concept romp, maybe. The characters were fine, the plot serviceable, and the two high concepts very high indeed. (Certainly the more interesting of those conceits is the one &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; advertized by the title of the book.) I’m not sad I read it; I also don’t think I’d read it again. I might even call it a bit overrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; Mary Robinette Kowal picks up her alt-history of the space program after a meteor strike and continues doing what sci-fi does best: throwing new light on present-day cultural issues by showing something that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the present day. Where the first book looked head-on at sexism, the second carries that line forward but digs in on racism as well. And all this while still being an exciting &lt;em&gt;novel&lt;/em&gt; with interesting characters and an engaging (if never quite surprising) novel. It doesn’t have quite the same magic &lt;em&gt;The Calculating Stars&lt;/em&gt; did, but I still enjoyed it very thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required:&lt;/strong&gt; Mary Robinette Kowal’s alt-history of the space program (after a meteor strike!) is wonderful—smashingly-good plotting which somehow makes a half decade span feel &lt;em&gt;urgent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fast-paced&lt;/em&gt;; a fantastic lead character; an interesting examination of women’s friendships; and frank treatment of both sexism and mental illness without being preachy about either. This was one of my favorite pieces of science-fiction I’ve read in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes you just need “popcorn”—and Sharon Lee and Steve Miller’s first novel is exactly that. (Just… pardon the frequent POV switches.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my friend &lt;a href="http://stephencarradini.com"&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt;’s recommendation (“a surprisingly fun sci-fi adventure romp. Lots of romantic tension, surprisingly chaste (and pretty satisfying) payoff [with] some of the coolest, most interesting protagonist aliens I’ve read about in a long time”) I picked up Sharon Lee and Steve Miller’s &lt;em&gt;Agent of Change&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I quite enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in the midst of hammering away at work and dealing with the tumult of moving into a new house, it’s nice to grab the literary equivalent of a bag of chips or a bowl of popcorn. This is that. There was nothing in this book that was anything like as interesting or engaging as sci-fi &lt;a href="http://v4.chriskrycho.com/2017/icehenge.html" title="Icehenge (review on this site)"&gt;can be&lt;/a&gt;—but it was, in Stephen’s words, an &lt;em&gt;adventure romp&lt;/em&gt;, and that was perfect. The characters are fun, well-drawn if never particularly surprising. The plot is essentially an escape story (and in more ways than it first appears).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; on display with the book is that it completely disregards anything like modern conventions around point-of-view. A paragraph break is sufficient for a total change of internal perspective. This drove me crazy the entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might I read another entry in this universe, the next time I’m looking for merely a romp? Indeed I might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agent of Change&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in their Liaden series. It’s also listed as anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the first book, because republication and branding have dropped it at its chronological position in their larger universe… but book &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; it is not, whatever Amazon tells you.&lt;a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

If you want the TL;DR, this is it:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended:&lt;/strong&gt; this is good sci-fi—the kind that makes you think while also being a bit of a page-turner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Stanley Robinson comes highly recommended, so in a moment of overwhelming need to read science fiction the other evening, I snagged a novel of his in ebook form, and read it over the weekend. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember being 6? I have only the barest glimmers of it. An image will come rushing back sometimes, of something I experienced then—a moment of delight, or horror, all at once, full of sensation and bright color and feeling. Or a smell will bring something from my teenage years back: cut grass makes me think of two-a-day practices for football, without fail. But the past is behind me in a way that is hard to describe, and which I have often thought about, but rarely so much as in the days I was reading (and in the days since finished reading) this little novel about the politics of Mars and a slowly-colonizing Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Icehenge&lt;/em&gt;, its name notwithstanding, really isn’t much at all about a massive Stonehenge-like construction, all of ice, on Pluto. It’s about memory, and what it would be like to live to 600 in a body that ages slowly but with a mind still incapable of holding on to the past, and the stories we tell to make sense of the world, and the hunger for truth, and the things that get in the way of the pure pursuit of the truth, and power, and loneliness, and what the past means and how we get at it in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect to be reading considerably more of KSR.&lt;/p&gt;
