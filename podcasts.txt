## Ongoing

* [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org) -- a show about technology, religion, ethics, and art (or, as I sometimes like to joke: literally everything humans do), cohosted with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com). Biweekly episodes when in the middle of a season; otherwise at our leisure.
* [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com) -- a show about the Rust programming language. Publishes roughly 3&times; monthly.

## Paused

* [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com) -- a show about the _Mass Effect_ trilogy, cohosted with my wife Jaimie. We'll be back at this... just as soon as we unpack our Xbox 360, because we forgot we might want it and some of the games with it, including _Mass Effect 2_ and _Mass Effect 3_, while between houses.

* [Run With Me](http://runwith.chriskrycho.com) -- a micro-podcast about running. I may pick this up in the near future; I enjoyed this show a lot, but had my headphones, with their built-in microphone, destroyed by our cat.

## Occasional

* [Sermons by Chris Krycho (dedicated RSS feed hosted on this site)](http://www.chriskrycho.com/sermons.xml) -- if ever I preach anywhere, it'll be in this feed. Currently just limited to the sermons I preached for my sermon delivery class in seminary.

## Concluded

* [Sap.py](https://sap-py.krycho.com) -- a short podcast I did with Jaimie about her adventures learning Python. Life got in the way and she chose to focus her many talents on other efforts.
