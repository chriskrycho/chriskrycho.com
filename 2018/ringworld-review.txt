<i class=editorial>I keep my book review ratings simple---they're either *required*, *recommended*, *recommended with qualifications*, or *not recommended*. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:</i>

**Recommended:** In want of a bit of classic sci-fi, I recently picked up Larry Niven’s <cite>Ringworld</cite> and read it this week. I enjoyed it, but more than that I find it hard to say. I’m still not sure exactly what to describe it as: an exploratory high concept romp, maybe. The characters were fine, the plot serviceable, and the two high concepts very high indeed. (Certainly the more interesting of those conceits is the one *not* advertized by the title of the book.) I’m not sad I read it; I also don’t think I’d read it again. I might even call it a bit overrated.
