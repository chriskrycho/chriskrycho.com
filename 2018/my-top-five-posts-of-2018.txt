    The best of my writing this year, ranked exactly and only by my opinion (I don’t have analytics to use even if I wanted to, and I don’t want to).

This time of year I see “most popular on my blog this year” posts flying around. I can’t share those because I stopped doing any kind of analytics half a decade ago and haven’t looked back. It’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever for my writing, and I commend it to you. In lieu of a “most read” posts (which you’re just reinforcing by doing that anyway!)

Instead, here are the top five *best* or *most important* posts I wrote this year, in my opinion.

1. [Tweet Less, Blog More—an uncomplicated game plan for writing this year.](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/tweet-less-blog-more.html) (January 2, ~500 words)

    Writing tweet storms can be immediately gratifying, but blogging is way better long-term. I hope you’ll consider it for 2019!

2. [“Stop Saying ‘What Capitalism Does’”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/stop-saying-what-capitalism-does.html) (March 9, ~1,000 words)

    Written after reading the influential essay “The Californian Ideology,” because the phrase “what __ does” makes such a mess of the complicated relationship between people and systems.

3. [“Building Things—a meander on leadership roles and the kinds of contributions we make.”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/building-things.html) (August 6, ~1,000 words)

    I had cause to reflect a *lot* this year on the shape of leadership in technical contexts; here I tried to thread some needles.

4. [“Dealing With Burnout In Public—because if I'm going to go through this, it might as well be a help to others.”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/dealing-with-burnout-in-public.html) (August 20, ~850 words)

    My attempt to provide a Christian frame for my approach to burnout—and why I blogged about it at such length.

5. [“Assumed Audiences—‘The Internet’ is far too broad an audience for, well, basically any post I write.”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html) (October 18, ~700 words)

    A new practice for myself, and an attempt to incept it into the world-at-large—because global audiences break everything.

And, as a bonus, a number of other things I think are interesting:

• [all my Zettelkasten posts](https://www.chriskrycho.com/zettelkasten/)
• [all my burnout posts](https://www.chriskrycho.com/burnout/)
• my most important technical post this year: [“Scales of Feedback Time in Software Development”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/scales-of-feedback-time-in-software-development.html)
• [“Free Speech”](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/free-speech.html)—on outsourcing all of our public discourse to social media
• ["How I Write a Talk"](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2018/how-i-write-a-talk.html)
