Just a quick note: I’m signing out of all social media until June 11. I’m on vacation from work for a week, and I’m taking the opportunity to enjoy the mental silence of not being on Twitter, *any* Slack instance, etc. (I may or may not be posting here along the way, but my feeling right now is that I *won't*.)

Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com) if you have something come up that needs my attention with any urgency; otherwise, I’ll be back in a week and a half.
