    What Cherry Blues are to some mechanical keyboard lovers, the Apple Magic Keyboard is to me.

<i>Assumed audience: nerds who care about keyboards, most of whom will probably think I’m crazy for my views in this post.</i>

I was sitting at my kitchen counter this evening, doing a mishmash of things—from writing a little Rust, to sending some text messages to my family, to leaving a note on a programming forum. The whole time, I’ve just had this quiet sense of deep pleasure about the typing. I was slightly confused about why I was enjoying the feel of the *typing* specifically… until I realized what exactly I was typing on.

I’m sitting in front of a 2015 MacBook Pro… but I’m not typing on that keyboard. I’m typing on the [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) instead, which I brought upstairs from its normal perch on my desk and started using *everywhere*.[^1]

This keyboard is *perfect* for me. It’s not what other people love, I know—people who prefer “mechanical keyboards” find it far too shallow. But there is something about the feeling of typing on this particular keyboard that I simply love. For me, it’s a perfect bit of industrial design, because it simultaneously <i>looks good</i> and <i>works exactly the way I want it to</i>, right down to the feeling of every keystroke.

Mechanical keyboard lovers: you can keep your Cherry Blues. I’ll just stockpile Apple Magic Keyboards and be happy.

P.S. Apple should totally just figure out how to put *exactly* this keyboard in their next-generation MacBook Pros. They won’t. But they should.

[^1]:	What prompted it? I ordered a stand for it for all the times I’m not at my desk with its 5k monitor. And then just decided it was worth doing this way *all* the time.
