## Overview

You write [Ember.js] apps. You think [TypeScript] would be helpful in building a more robust app as it increases in size or has more people working on it. But you have questions about how to make it work.

[Ember.js]: https://emberjs.com
[TypeScript]: http://www.typescriptlang.org

This is the series for you! I'll talk through everything: from the very basics of how to set up your Ember.js app to use TypeScript to how you can get the most out of TypeScript today---and I'll be pretty clear about the current tradeoffs and limitations, too.
