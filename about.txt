Hello! I’m Chris Krycho (thus the <abbr>URL</abbr>).

![My wonderful family! [(see full size)](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/chriskrycho-com/images/family-2017.jpg)](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/chriskrycho-com/images/family-2017-thumb.jpg 'Family photo 2017')

A few things about me you might find interesting:

* I’m a Christian: catholic, Reformed, and Presbyterian.

* I’m the happy husband of [Jaimie Krycho](http://jaimiekrycho.com).

* I’m the delighted dad of two little girls, Ellie and Kate.

* We live in Colorado.

* I write software for a living—these days mostly [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) (with a nice smattering of <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>SCSS</abbr>, and now even some <abbr>CSS</abbr> Modules!) in a large [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) app. I also sometimes dip my toes into the C^♯^ and F^♯^ codebases at work, and I do an awful lot of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) related things on the side, including some WebAssembly! Past work has included Fortran, C, <abbr>PHP</abbr>, C++, Python, and JavaScript. 

    I also maintain several open source projects, most importantly:

    * [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) – use TypeScript in your Ember.js 2.x apps!

    * [True Myth](https://github.com/chriskrycho/true-myth/tree/master/src) – a library for safer programming in JavaScript, with first-class support for TypeScript. (`Maybe` and `Result` types and helpers!)

* I host podcasts!

  * [Winning Slowly](http://www.winningslowly.org): a show I cohost with [Stephen Carradini](http://stephencarradini.com), taking the long view on technology, religion, ethics, and art—or, as I sometimes describe it to people, “everything humans do”

  * [New Rustacean](http://www.newrustacean.com): a show about the Rust programming language and the people using it

  * [Mass Affection](https://www.massaffection.com): a show about _Mass Effect_ which I cohost with my wife Jaimie (because we’re nerds!)

* I write extensively here about technology, art, and faith.

* I also sometimes also write at [Mere Orthodoxy](https://mereorthodoxy.com).

* I run—a lot! I try to do at least one half marathon every year. I also cycle a fair bit and sometimes even swim, with the occasional triathlon tossed in.

* Every once in a long while, I also compose new music.
