ARCHIVED README CONTENT
=======================

Here I version control my website. Everything is public, because anything I have
here is *already* public. Moreover, all of this material is provided open source
so that others can learn from, remix, and otherwise make use of it. There is
just one restriction on that: if you're going to use the material, please do me
the favor of crediting me for it. That's just being kind.

Note that that typefaces are *not* licensed this way: I've bought my own license
to commercial typefaces. You're welcome to use the same typefaces on your own
site, but you're not welcome to use *my copies* of them. (For some great general
recommendations on typography, see [_Butterick's Practical Typography_], which
includes [specific recommendations] for fonts of certain styles, and is just an
excellent overall resource.)

So... now what?
---------------

To see how the site *works*, look at [the `master` branch], which has the
[Pelican] configuration, [Jinja2] templates, etc., as well as all the Markdown
files which constitute the content of the site (but before conversion).

[Pelican]: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/
[Jinja2]: http://jinja.pocoo.org
[the `master` branch]: https://github.com/chriskrycho/chriskrycho.com/tree/master

To get the site itself, look at [the `gh-pages` branch]. Because of the way
[Pelican] and [GitHub Pages] play together, you can actually check out the site
from any point in time since I started hosting it. That's only mildly
interesting (at best!) from a content perspective, but it may be interesting if
you are curious to see how the design aesthetic of the site has changed over
time.
