<i class=editorial>I keep my book review ratings simple---they're either *required*, *recommended*, *recommended with qualifications*, or *not recommended*. If you want the TL;DR, this is it:</i>

**Recommended:** Thomas Kidd’s <cite>What is an Evangelical?</cite> is a short and accessible history of “evangelicalism”: where it came from and how it developed into the multifaceted movement it is today, including but very much not limited to its political engagement. Even-handed and well-researched, but accessible – you don’t have to be a religious history buff to follow this (and if you are it’ll probably be a lot you already know). The book’s biggest weakness, sadly, is Kidd’s prose: it gets the job done, but gets pretty monotonous. That aside, this is a great introductory history of the movement that is such a cause of political consternation.
