  abstract: In his paper “A Confutation of Convergent Realism”, Larry Laudan offered
    one of the most powerful criticisms of scientific realism. I defend here that
    although Laudan’s criticism is right, this does not refute the realist position.
    The thesis that Laudan confutes is a much stronger thesis than realist needs to
    maintain. As I will exemplify with Salmon’s statistical-relevance model, a less
    strict notion of explanation would allow us to claim that (approximate) truth
    is the best explanation for such success, even if it is accepted that there can
    be cases of unsuccessful (approximately) true theories and cases of successful
    false theories. $[$ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR$]$; Copyright of Journal for General Philosophy

  abstract: In recent papers Hans Halvorson has offered a critique of the semantic
    view of theories, showing that theories may be the same although the corresponding
    sets of models are different and, conversely, that theories may be different although
    the corresponding sets of models are the same. This critique will be assessed,
    first, as it pertains to issues concerning scientific models in the empirical
    sciences and, second, independent of any concern with empirical science. \[ABSTRACT

  abstract: A scientific theory offers models for the phenomena in its domain; these
    models involve theoretical quantities, and a model’s structure is the set of relations
    it imposes on these quantities. A fundamental demand in scientific practice is
    for those quantities to be clearly and feasibly related to measurement. This demand
    for empirical grounding can be artic- ulated by displaying the theory-dependent
    criteria for a procedure to count as a measure- ment and for identifying the quantity
    it measures.

  abstract: After introducing the empiricist point of view in philosophy of science,
    and the concepts and methods of the semantic approach to scientific theories,
    Professor van Fraassen discusses quantum theory in three stages. He first examines
    the question of whether and how empirical phenomena require a non-classical theory,
    and what sort of theory they require. He then discusses the mathematical foundations
    of quantum theory with special reference to developments in themodelling of interaction,
    composite systems, and measurement. Finally, the author broaches the main questions
    of interpretation. After offering a critique of earlier interpretations, he develops
    a new one - the modal interpretation - which attempts to stay close to the original
    Copenhagen ideaswithout implying a radical incompleteness in quantum theory. He
    gives special attention to the character of composite, many-body systems and especially
    to the peculiar character of assemblies of identical particles in quantum statistics.

  abstract: Physicalists argued that “intentional” or semantical properties can be
    reduced to physical ones of the appropriate type. The familiar problem is that
    the physicalist is going to have difficulty specifying what counts as the “appropriate
    type” without using semantical notions. The notion of “cause,” used in mathematical
    physics is “causation,” and is a precise relation between “states” of a system,
    involving the existence of a transformation function, which deterministically
    “carries” the earlier state into the later state.
